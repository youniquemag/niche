  We’ve always known the Chinese to be a weird bunch of people but recent reports have revealed that an indoor farm in China is breeding nearly 6 billion cockroaches a year. According to the government it’s a part of the production process of a healing potion which the Chinese consume.<br><br>

  Nearly 28,000 full-sized cockroaches per square foot are produced there annually, the Sichuan government said in a report submitted to Beijing early this year. The world’s largest cockroach farm is breeding 6 billion adult cockroaches a year and using artificial intelligence to manage a colony larger than the world’s human population – all for medicinal use. It is warm, humid and dark all year round, with freedom to roam to find food and reproduce. Fully sealed like a prison, it has strict limitations on access to visitors. From birth to death, inhabitants never see the sun.<br><br>

  According to certain reports, the facility is controlled by artificial intelligence making it the most efficient facility in all over China. The system constantly collects and analyses more than 80 categories of “big data”, including humidity, temperature, food supply and consumption. It monitors changes such as genetic mutations and how these affect the growing rates of individual cockroaches.<br><br>
  
  Human access is highly restricted in this facility and those who are allowed in this facility need to wear specially designed suits which prevent them from bringing any kind of pollutants in the facility. 
  Not much details are available about the facility but it would be a huge catastrophe if all of these cockroaches somehow escaped the facility and spread into the nearby areas. To prevent a disaster like this, the facility is surrounded by a moat which is filled with fish. These fish eat up any cockroach which ends up escaping the facility. <br><br>
