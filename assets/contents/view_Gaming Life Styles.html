  A person grows older. He changes. Inevitable. Desirable. Change as a phenomenon itself is desirable though a certain change may or may not be from a certain angle of visualisation. In a world of billions, billions of adjectives need to be defined to express what each individual is.
  Some think like boxes while others prefer thinking like web. Look into a change from the closest view you can and then zoom out. The bigger the picture you wish to see, the difference pops up. But which of it or how much of it is true? All of it. May be none of it. But we humans prefer “some of it”.
  <br><br>
  Gaming creeped into my life since I was thirteen. The cassettes plugged into the console was what I craved for. With years, the knack for it grew and grew enough to stick with me and survive the test of time.
  <br><br>
  When changes mould around a constant direction, I believe it defines one to an extent just as much as one defines the change he is about to go through. So how does my gaming define me? And how do I, as a person, define my gaming style?
  <br><br>
  Let's take an example. Counter Strike. A game played by millions. Assaulter. My favourite position. I am the guy behind the first two. In terms of risk, it's a safer position. Yet, a position that gives you the right balance of risk and opportunity. I like to be led where the leader can make optimum use of my skill set. I prefer having more ground knowledge before my actions start speaking for me. But doesn't all these make me sound weak?
  <br><br>
  In life, real and virtual, I prefer knowing that the efforts I put in yield to something. Like every other creature, appreciation is important to me too. When your team is down and you, as an assaulter, wipe the entire enemy out of existence with an ace, you feel that your efforts are bringing fruits. Pretty heavenly a feeling. The rushing joy glitters you up. It's, however, not really about being the most daring and rather being the most sensible. How the balance of your skills and knowledge with risk and opportunity works is really a math for many to do. Be it life or gaming.

  In cricket, the openers score the leading runs. After they get out, the third person carries the game forward. Either to finish it or to make it easy for the finishers to do the job. So please don't get me wrong. I love the burden. I love how I, a menial creature, can make a difference to the cause I'm in for. Before I dive in, I need to know that my effort would matter … at least in some way and to the best of my capabilities.
  <br><br>
  Is it an insecurity? Is it a way to make my own self feel that I am of some significance when deep down somewhere in my heart I know that I am not?
  <br><br>
  You as an assaulter never had the patience of a sniper. Accept it or deny it but an assaulter is always up for quick action and a more agile player on the map than a lousy sniper!
   <br><br>
  In my observations, assaulter is a position that an amateur either loves or absolutely hates. When they hate it they may say that they aren't as impactful as the other players. But the satisfaction to head in like a conqueror and bring the enemy down is undeniable.
  <br><br>
  Let me mention that these preferences in my gaming and its style also defines me as a person, not just in the virtual world. Every time, while riding my motorbike, when I am required to make a quick decision, the habit and conditions in gaming have developed in me the sense of quick judgement and not hassle with the decisions when time is of the essence. Gaming taught me how every situation is winnable if you work hard enough. It showed how the simplest of the decisions can result in a different outcome altogether … at times in binary. The very humane motivation of “good residing over evil” is something I felt and grew over time. Well I am no expert gamer, but gaming to me is an emotion which can't be expressed in words.
  <br><br>
  But what about the otherwise? At times I feel when in the real world, the risk taking threshold is reduced. A game in itself requires a commitment of a couple of hours at max but a real life objective? You die in a game, you can get your “life” back but what about in reality? As consequence of losing a game, you lose resources but there's always scope for a new game.
  <br><br>
  But in reality? May be the difference makes us realise the reality a bit better than the non-gamers or does it make us more delusional? Confusions. But then again, aren't confusions a basic component of the human psyche?
