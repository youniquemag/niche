  <p style="text-align: center;">INTRODUCTION</p>
  <br><br>
  In the days of Capitalist ventures like the modern era, capitalism intervenes at almost each and everything. Right from the very primary needs such as food, clothing and shelter to the entertainment section and field of technology, capital has its hand everywhere. In such a situation all over the world, it is not news of awe that capital has intervened time and again in the field of sports in its own will. Sports such as Cricket and football are popular all over the world. The fact ensures that these popular sports attract tens of thousands of eyes every time it is played in a grand scale. Hence, these sports become a way to produce much profit if used in a concentrated and channelized way. Consequently, these sports (i.e. Cricket, Football, Hockey etc.) have faced capitalist ventures and intervention time and again. These interventions have not only made profit for the investors, but also revolutionised the forms of the game and ensured the evolution of the popular sports. The following paper would try to chalk its way through these changes and would try to find out how the capitalist intervention has evolved the game with special emphasis on the game of Cricket. 
  <br><br>
  The game of Cricket dates back to almost 1550 approximately. It was played in the village of Guildford in the county of Surrey as it has been found. Though the game was played for a long time in nations such as England and Wales, Australia and India, the international matches as well as the first class matches were usually played in the test format where the game moved very slowly and usually took a minimum of three or four days time to conclude. The first limited over cricket started in the year 1963 when the first major One-day tournament known as the ‘Gillette Cup’[1] inaugurated. Capital made sure that it is involved in the events by sponsoring the aforesaid competition. Later the TCCB (TCCB- the forerunner of the ECB) started the limited over Sunday League[2] in the year 1969. The first international was played between Australia and England in the year 1971 in the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 
  
  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">THE CRICKET WORLD CUP: THE ENTRY OF GLOBAL CAPITAL</p>
  <br><br>

  The inauguration of the Cricket World Cup in the year 1975 was the first big boost to the limited over format of Cricket. Though it was the first international tournament, a triangular cricket tournament was endeavoured for the first time in history was in the year 1912 amongst England, Australia and South Africa. The plans, though, were abandoned due to the hideous weather condition of England. The idea to hold a limited over global tournament was put forward by Ben Brocklehurst[3] in 1969. But in the ICC annual meeting of 1973, the plans to organise a World Cup was tabled. The Marylebone Cricket Club put together first such event in 1975. The inaugural Cricket World Cup was held in England. The sponsorship of the World Cup tournament once again saw the intervention of capital and it made sure that it does not miss out the opportunity to be involved in the first global event of Cricket.. The first three world cups (1975, 1979 and 1983 respectively) were hosted by England and were sponsored by the Prudential Insurance Company. Hence, the winners’ trophy was named after the sponsor company’s name and called the Prudential Cup. The World Cup initially was thought to be taken place in England only as the organizers thought that no other country apart from England would be ‘able to garner the resources to stage such an event’.[4] But the fourth edition of the World Cup moved out of England as India and Pakistan played hosts to the mega event of the cricketing world. With the Prudential Insurance Company no more sponsoring the World Cup, the name of the cup changed to Reliance World Cup as the Reliance Commercial Corporations secured themselves as the sponsor of the mega event held in the subcontinent. The first four edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup (’75, ’79, ’83, ’87 respectively) were played in the traditional all white attires and red ball. The modern day ‘Gimmicks’[5] such as the coloured clothing with names and numbers printed on the back, white ball, floodlight matches were introduced in the 1992 World Cup much after Kerry Packer’s breakaway World Series had set the trend in the late 1970s.

  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">KERRY PACKER SERIES: A ‘HOWZAT’ BY GLOBAL CAPITAL</p>
  <br><br>

  The inaugural World Cup though, making very little profit turned out  to be a great hit with the spectators and followers alike when it  was played in glorious sunshine over a two week period in June. Kerry Packer much like his father Sir Frank was an ever the opportunist. In the early 1970s Channel Nine[6] had successfully telecasted professional golf tournaments with American legend Jack Nicklaus as his major drawcard. With the introduction of the colour television into Australia in 1975 and the ABC’s overwhelming success of the live telecast of the World Cup One-day Cricket tournament final from London, Packer could see the potential  of Cricket to enhance Channel Nine’s rating figures. He subsequently decided that he could buy his way into Cricket broadcasting by offering the owners of Cricket in Australia, the ACB a deal that was too good to refuse. The ACB, however, refused the offer which was more than $ 1 million more than being paid by the ABC which held the television broadcasting rights to Cricket since televisions establishment in Australia in 1956. There were also problems of how he might push aside Channel 7 and 10, who shared the non-exclusive rights to broadcast some of the first class cricket games at this time. 
  <br><br>

  Packer not only got more determined when he did not get what he wanted in the first go. He sought the television rights of the upcoming Jubilee test series between England and Australia which would be played in England in 1977. Without the knowledge of either ACB or ABC, Packer offered the governing body of English Cricket, the TCCB a sum of $300,000 for the rights to televise all the Tests and One-day games back to Australia, a massive amount at the time for an event that would be telecast in the late evening and early morning in Australia. This offer did turn out to be too good to refuse and Channel Nine laughed all the way to bank on the back of some very impressive rating figures. The next step in Packer’s foray into first class cricket was accompanied by the entrepreneurial flair of Austin Roberts[7], a journalist and player agent and John Cornell[8], better known as the sidekick of the famous Australian comedian and actor Paul Hogan. By the middle of 1977, Robertson and Cornell had contracted 35 of the world’s best cricketers to play in International tournament in Australia. Packer also used England captain Tony Greig and Australian captain Ian Chappell who did the bulk of local recruitment.[9] By the end of the year, 50 had signed up contracts that were unimaginable under the traditional cricket set up. For example, during the hearing of the WSC in the High Court, it came to the knowing that Australian fast bowler Alan Hurst had turned down ‘a $75,000 three-year WSC contract in October after his club North Melbourne had made a counter offer’. [10]
  <br><br>

  The news broke on May 9, 1977 as the Australians prepared for their Ashes Series in Engand-13 out of 17 had signed for Packer. The media reactions were unwelcoming while the establishment were unable to hide their fury. WSC soon came to be known as ‘Packer’s Circus’.[11] Greig was stripped of the England captaincy and was singled out by vitriolic attacks by the press while many wanted who had signed banned from playing anywhere. Over the summer, many more signings emerged, while Australia, a far from happy side, lost the series and the Ashes 3-0.  While many regarded Packer as the ‘Cricket’s antichrist’[12], there was no denying his passion and eloquence. Against a slick media operator, the cricketing establishment looked like a floundering dinosaurs. His cause was further aided by the recruitment of the famous cricketer turned commentator Richie Benaud as his advisor. 
  <br><br>

  The ICC was slow to respond to what it initially saw as an ‘all Australian’[13] affair. But as recruiting increased, ICC came to understand that the WSC would affect the game across the globe. The ICC met with Packer in London on June 23. Initially it seemed that both of the sides would reach an agreement but talks broke down over Packer’s insistence over Channel Nine  be  awarded TV rights for the 1978-79 season. That was outside the ICC’s powers. Packer stormed out with a clean message: ‘It’s every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost.’[14] The comment polarised opinions and fired up the establishment. In July, the ICC ruled out that any Packer matches were not first-class and that anyone taking part would be banned from first-class and Test cricket. For a while many players wavered. Packer acted quickly to protect his interest and launched his lawyers against the boards and the ICC. Greig, Mike Procter and John Snow, backed by Packer, took the TCCB, to High Court claiming resistant of trade. For seven weeks, starting from September 26, 1977, the case was played out with massive global interest. On November 26, Justice Slade delivered his verdict, finding for the plaintiffs, arguing that professional cricketers need to make a living and the ICC was wrong to stand in the way just because its own interests may be damaged. The cost to the establishment was close to £250,000 as costs were awarded against them. 
  <br><br>

  During the first season, there was not much turn out in favor of Packer’s WSC. In the first supertest[15], there was only an attendance of 2000 in the 79,000 capacity Melbourne VFL Park. But the imparity did not last too long. Packer poured in the money into advertising and marketing with famous faces to back the media push. It was ruthless. The WSC was all about ruthlessness. It was all about fast bowling and big sixes. Traditional grafters and spinners did not stand any chance. Batsmen were subject to the bouncer barrage, which is today known as the ‘Sweet Chin Music’. WSC also removed the ban to bowl short length ball to the tail enders. Not only did the WSC change the playing techniques, but also introduced certain new protective gears such as the helmet. 
  <br><br>

  The first cracks in the establishment hardline came in March 1978 when Simpson's young side headed to the Caribbean. With the WSC season finished, the West Indies board picked their full-strength side, including all Packer's rebels. While England refused to pick their rebels - Greig, Derek Underwood, Alan Knott and Bob Woolmer - in the 1978 summer, many WSC-contracted players turned out in county cricket. Pakistan also refused to pick Packer players but relaxed when more players were signed between seasons. The other main World XI contingent came from politically-isolated South Africa, with New Zealand and India unaffected. Though the establishment had won the ‘war’[16]  of the 1977-78 season, in the very next season, Packer’s marketing and advertising hit home. On the opening day of the second season of WSC, on November 28, 1978, a crowd of 44,377 attended the first one-day match of the series between Packer’s Australia and West Indies side. It was also the first floodlight game in a traditional venue-the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Packer's marketing also hit home, targeting women and children. By the end of the summer it was clear that the ACB were on the back foot. The final Supertest between Australia and the World attracted 40,000 over three days; the final official Test 22,000 over four days. Desperate to redress the imbalance, the ACB hastily scheduled two Tests against Pakistan, who fielded their Packer rebels. The WSC circus then upped and headed to the Caribbean for a series that was remorseless on the field and fiery off it. The five Supertests and 12 ODIs were popular with the public and, most importantly to the region, bailed the West Indies board out of a financial hole.
  <br><br>

  At the end of the season the ACB was hemorrhaging cash and goodwill. Its resources were limited and were at risk of being reduced by WSC while Packer poured more money into the project. During March the two parties sat in a series of meetings that resulted in an announcement of a truce on May 30, 1979. It was clear as the daylight that who had won. Packer did not only get the rights of broadcasting all the tests and the first class matches to be played in Australia but also granted a  ten-year deal to promote and  market the game. As it turns out, the broadcasting rights of all the Australian cricket matches which include first class cricket as well as all the international action have stayed in Channel  Nine’s hands till date. 

  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">RESULTS</p>
  <br><br>

  So, what were the outcomes of Kerry Packer’s WSC? According to famous Indian journalist Minhaz Merchant, Kerry Packer’s WSC ‘rejuvenated’[17] the game of Cricket. According to him, “Cricket traditionalists now concede, though grudgingly, that Packer's injection of commercialized hype has revitalized cricket. Like most British 'institutions' cricket was an ageing sport and rigor mortis would probably have set in had Packer not introduced his concept of dramatized cricket. Of course, some of the gimmicks will soon die a natural death - for instance, pink and yellow jump suits worn by prancing, self-conscious cricketers. But concepts like night cricket, white balls and modified playing rules are here to stay. Test cricket will ultimately have to adapt them.”[18] Merchant further argues that the WSC had set parity between the earnings of the WSC and the non-WSC player. He compares that it was $30,000 (INR 2.76 Lakhs appx.) a year for a WSC player such as Tony Greig or Ian Chappell through sponsorship frills, prize money and TV commercials. The test players, such as ex-England all-rounder Sir Ian Botham and Sunil Gavaskar easily raked a yearly income of $ 25,000 (INR 2.30 Lakhs appx.) through Test fees, prize money, TV appearance etc. And he was very right in his predictions. Not very soon, but in the World Cup of 1992, the ICC approved Packer’s ‘Gimmicks’ of colored clothing with names and numbers on the back of the players’ jerseys, floodlights and white ball matches. The corporate sponsorships remained the same as the World Cup trophy went on changing names (the trophy presented in 1992 was known as Benson and Hedges World Cup as Benson and Hedges were the sponsors and the trophy presented in 1996 was known as Wills World Cup as Wills was the sponsor) till the ICC decided to make their own trophy to present to the winners in the 1999 World Cup which is presented till date. The new format of Cricket received unprecedented popularity. Crowds poured into the stands to make it a full house. The One-day international format gained huge popularity until the latest and the game’s shortest format came calling with gala success-the Twenty20, or as we know it today, the T20 format came to the fore in 2003. 

  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">T20 CRICKET-CRICKET’S LATEST ‘GIMMICK’</p>
  <br><br>

  The T20 format came to the fore in 2003.  According to the inventor of the T20 format of the game Stuart Robertson, in 2001, the international games were at the buoyant but the county games in England were at a steep decline. Robertson commissioned a massive consumer research into what the ECB would do to make the county cricket popular again. They spent £200,000 to identify ‘who were coming to cricket and who were not and why’[19]. It was understood that something had to be done that would make cricket popular once again to people who were ‘cash rich but time poor’[20].  Though people had been playing T20 cricket for a long time, but it was a radical idea to professionalize the format.  Robertson worked closely with the cricket department of the ECB and a T20 competition was invented to replace the old Benson and Hedges Cup and it was put to vote of the county chairmen who voted in 11-7 in favor of adopting it. The county board held its breath as the first T20 match took place in the Rose Bowl between Hampshire and Sussex. Crowd filled in to see the four hours’ match. The slogan of the newly found league was: ‘I don’t like Cricket, I love it!’[21] After the completion of the match, one of the players, Ed Giddin told in his interview that it was the best game of cricket that he had played in. He also mentioned that the atmosphere was amazing[22]. Soon after it was introduced and gained success in England, South Africa, West Indies and Australia also adopted the game. The first international T20 match was played between New Zealand and Australia in 2005. With its rising popularity, the ICC decided to start a T20 World Cup. South Africa played the hosts and it was an instant hit. After their victory in the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, India almost made this format her own through launching the newest cricket circus in the year 2008 which is known as the Indian Premier League or IPL. 

  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE: CORPORATES KI ‘WAH RE WAH’</p>
  <br><br>

  Almost after four decades later Kerry Packer’s WSC, the IPL started in the year 2008. It was the brain child of the then BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi. After its introduction in 2008, the IPL has only grown in wealth and stature. With a Premier League like arrangement to take home all the best players in the world moving alongside the glitz and glitter of Bollywood, IPL is perhaps the biggest hotcake to the BCCI. An eight team game with franchisees owned by Bollywood superstars (Shahrukh Khan and Juhi Chawla own the Kolkata franchise, Preity Zinta owns the Punjab franchise and Shilpa Shetty co-owns the Rajasthan franchise), corporate giants such as Vijay Malya’s UB group as well as Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance group etc., the players plying in the month and a half long tournament actually become millionaires in day. But does this million dollar tournament with all its glamour serves the most important aspect of the tournament: Cricket? 
  <br><br>

  There have emerged number of players from the tournament such  as R.Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh  Yadav to name a few but certainly it does not keep parity with the money invested and the revenues earned by the corporate houses and TNCs with  the rate of bringing of budding talents. The corporate houses investing in the IPL certainly receive huge revenues. Sony Pictures Networks India had raked a whooping INR 1,200 Cr. in 2015[23] only through advertisement. According to the stats, it was a 20% increase[24] in revenues through advertising only. With the viewership touching 500 million in the urban sector only, the stars are in favor of the official broadcast partner of the IPL. 
  <br><br>

  So, how do the various franchises rake their revenues from the tournament?  Till 2012, the revenue was split in three major ways. The broadcasting rights earned $ 1 billion to the BCCI which was divided in three parts: IPL retained 20% of the revenue, 8% was given as the prize money and the rest of the 72% profit was distributed equally amongst eight participating franchises[25]. The franchises apart from their shares of the money from the broadcasting rights given by them by the IPL itself, can also use to put advertisement in the stadiums, license the original  team merchandise, get sponsorships for the jerseys of  their teams, advertise the ticket sales etc. According to the stats of 2008, the ticket sales would surely provide $ 2 million income from each match for 7 home matches which would account to $ 10 million of fortune while the franchises would have to pay 20% as local tax[26]. And the TV ratings have only increased. 
  <br><br>

  IPL with all its corporate backing changed the scenario of cricket in a flash. It was an instant hit amongst the Indian population. Since the days of the WSC, the one-day internationals had ruled the world of cricket. The IPL popularized the already popular T20 cricket further. The game was very less time consuming with glamour of Bollywood stars and charm of the pom-pom carrying foreign cheerleaders and hard hitting. Sixes and fours were in plenty. Much like the WSC, it was ruthless. But it was the turn for the batsmen to pick the bones out of the bowlers. Furthermore, it was the ideal kind of entertainment for the time weary generation Z as the time has drastically been shortened by the T20 format. Whereas a One-day game would consume the whole day, the T20 game would take only four hours for its completion. Soon, being inspired by the success story of the IPL, the other cricket playing nations also started their own T20 leagues such as the Big Bash league of Australia, the Hero Caribbean Premier League of the West Indies and the Bangladesh Premier League of Bangladesh. What it has further done, the T20 format of cricket has not only curbed the popularity of the One-day international cricket, but also has pushed the traditional form of cricket, i.e. the Test cricket to the edge.
  <br><br>

  But does the IPL have any similarity with the WSC apart from being the changing corporate backup which changed the game as a technology? According to journalist Paajivs Punter, ‘come to think of it, the IPL seemed to be more of a reaction to Subhash Chandra’s[27]  Indian Cricket League (ICL), which was closer to WSC in terms of narrative. The underdog wouldn't win the fistfight with the establishment this time around — after a couple of popular seasons, the ICL raised the white flag. The IPL may be India’s (and indeed, the world’s) pre-eminent T20 tournament, but the ICL was the first to showcase the commercial potential of the format on Indian shores. Come to think of it, the IPL cannot claim credit for many innovative ideas even though Lalit Modi maintains that it is ahead of its time. The format originated in England; the IPL was modelled on various sporting leagues across the world like the NBA; the concepts of the super-over and cheerleaders were adopted directly from the World T20; the Spidercam was first seen in the ICL; Flashing wickets first made an appearance in the Big Bash League (BBL). It is an uncomfortable truth that the richest T20 league in the world is not at the forefront of technological innovation in the game of cricket.’[28]
  <br><br>

  In conclusion, all we can say is that though the Global Capital did move for its own purpose, but without quiet noticing its own deeds, the capitalist ventures have done massive advances into Cricket as a technology. Not only did they change Cricket as technology, but also the changing forms have initiated a change in the Cricketing technology. The players have emerged to be fitter, more powerful and more agile on the field. Furthermore, for the sake of the game, the equipments of the game have been ever evolving with the protective gear becoming better and better day by day and the bats becoming thicker but lighter. The Test format has also undergone various changes for surviving its entity as the ICC has been conducting the day and night test using a special pink ball. The speed of the game has certainly increased to adapt with the other formats and to attract the crowd. All the formats of the game now witness the new Decision Review System (DRS) which has certainly decreased the number of mistakes in the cases of LBW and caught behind decisions by the umpires. We can only hope that with the eye of the capital on an ever-expanding, ever-changing game such as cricket, we shall see more fruitful changes and developments.
