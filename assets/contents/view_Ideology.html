  <br>
  Rocks crushed by the waves of emotion,<br>
  Trees broken by the storms of passion,<br>
  The milestone that stood its steady ground ...<br>
  Logic, lust and love profound.
  <br><br><br>
  Ideology. A good thing to possess. That's like your own set of personal rules. You are the writer, the judge and the defendant. What does the law schools say? Should it be an easy case to win?
  <br><br><br>
  "To be right" - is all what we want.<br>
  Desires flood in to dance and flaunt.<br>
  Bend it hither and break it thither,<br>
  The tree starts to change its form.
  <br><br><br>
  Okay ... now you have set your own rules and then begin to break them yourself! So technically, you are comparing your set of rules to some higher set of rules you have. With the bend and the breaks, your entire set of principles might have changed. But why? What is the source of this force?
  <br><br><br>
  The wheels rusty ... The streets dusty.<br>
  Though the sun still bright ... but age in sight.<br>
  He moves along ... but in his own right.
  <br><br><br>
  The hand knows what it feels. The legs know where they rest. You know now what the world might mean to you. Your rule book is changing less - rarely bending and almost never breaking.
  <br><br><br>
  The shape it has ...<br>
  The birds it feeds ...<br>
  Makes him up an honest dream.<br>
  Though foggy air ...<br>
  But lights in sight ...<br>
  He tries to exist in his own right.
