  Respected Reader, if you like to read this article, have infinite forgiveness in your mind for the mistakes I made here.<br><br>
  Common sayings like, - “Where science ends philosophy begins” notoriously lead to gruesome misconceptions not as much of the meanings of the terms like science and philosophy as of the meanings of the simple words like “ends” and “begins” in particular cases. Some people will convey you the meaning of the above mentioned saying like this - when science halts at the dead end of a blind lane of investigation of truth, philosophy comes forward to rescue us through a route to escape to a beautiful land of wisdom. This sort of explanation imparts a superiority of one field of knowledge to the other. Perhaps a healthy mind will extract the meaning of the above saying somewhat like this – “when science comprehends a truth of nature after much investigation and experimentation, the next task of finding its relation to the totality of our rational thinking and its effect on our wellbeing is shouldered by philosophy. So philosophy begins its duty when science completes its performance.”<br><br>
  Now let us diagnose the disease of mind of the people who give the former interpretation. Certainly they have never pondered over any field of knowledge. Moreover, they always pose to be very wise in all fields of knowledge. They find it to be risky to talk about any scientific finding, as a slight departure from it will prove their folly. They have the wrong notion that any sort of comment may be accommodated in philosophy. So they find a chance to make philosophy superior to science. They proclaim that philosophy is the supreme field of knowledge and then find it very safe to comment on anything and to opine that the comment is philosophical. They don’t know that the field of philosophy is not a donkey’s playground. Rigid stupidity admixed with pretention of being wise is the disease they are suffering from. This disease has no cure. Its only prevention is to learn from sources that are accepted as authentic all over the world.<br><br>
  Let us now search for what physics and philosophy deal with.<br><br>
  Oxford dictionary says that physics is the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy.<br><br>
  Cambridge dictionary says that physics is the scientific study of matter and energy and the effect that they have on each other.<br><br>

  Encyclopaedia Britannica describes physics as the science that deals with the structure of matter and the interactions between the fundamental constituents of the observable universe. In the broadest sense, physics is concerned with all aspects of nature on both the microscopic and sub-microscopic levels. Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of objects under the action of given forces but also the nature and origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force fields. Its ultimate objective is the formulation of a few comprehensive principles that bring together and explain all such disparate phenomena. <br><br>
  Oxford dictionary defines philosophy as the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality and existence especially when considered as an academic discipline.<br><br>
  Cambridge dictionary defines philosophy as the use of reason in understanding such things as the nature of the real world and existence, the use and limits of knowledge, and the principles of moral judgement.<br><br>
  Encyclopaedia Britannica describes philosophy as the rational, abstract, and methodical consideration of reality as a whole or of fundamental dimensions of human existence and experience.<br><br>
  Possessing this knowledge about the concern of physics and philosophy we now proceed to analyse the philosophical implications of some fundamental thoughts evolved out of keen investigations of the physicists. To do that we at first think about two terms, “meaning” and “definition”. Academicians lay much stress on these two terms. To understand the meaning of some word we use another. If we then seek the meaning of this another word, we are to seek another more. For example, we seek the meaning of gruesome. Oh it is dreadful. What is dreadful? Oh it is horrendous. What is that? Oh that means horrifying. What is that, again? That is terrible. What is terrible? That is horrible. What is horrible? It is frightening. What is that? That is fearsome and that is fearful. Yes, now I understand, says the questioner. Why does the questioner stop here? Because the guy understands or knows what fear is. After a while I will come to the field of understanding or knowing something. Now I come to the case of definition. For example, energy is defined to be the quantity that is the measure of the capacity of a system for doing work. Here we need to define work. Work is defined to be the product of the displacement times the component of the force along the displacement when a body has this displacement due to this force. Again, force is mass times acceleration. Acceleration is the time-rate of change of velocity. Velocity is time-rate of change of displacement. Now we need to define displacement. So we see that to indicate the meaning of a word or to define a term we require words other than the given word or term. Again, for the meaning or definition of those other words or terms we require more new words, and so on. But the number of words in any language is not infinite. Then how will you learn or understand meanings and definitions? See that the above mentioned questioner got satisfied when he heard the word fear, because he understands or knows what fear is. But what is meant by the sentence “he understands what fear is”? Obviously it means that he has the experience of a particular unpleasant feeling when he gets afraid. If a group of scientists consists of a psychologist, a neurologist, a physician (specialised in brain functioning), an endocrinologist, a microbiologist, an anthropologist etc., the group can write a bulky book on “fear”. Reading that book one can know something about fear. So to know something about such a small word like fear, demands this much of huge activity.<br><br>

  Let us now come to the analysis of some thoughts evolved out of keen investigations of the physicists.<br><br>
  For example, a body at rest remains at rest without any external push or pull. Similarly, a body at uniform motion in a straight line (having no obstruction in motion like friction of ground or air, viscous drag of water etc.) will remain so without any external push or pull. Such behaviour of a body had been observed by all. Newton just wrote this observed fact as his first law of motion. But why does a body behave so? Philosophers observed that nothing happens without the occurrence of a change, and a change never occurs without a cause. A cause effects the change. In other words, every effect has its cause. Philosophers call it the cause and effect relation. In this case, change of state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line is the effect and external push or pull is the cause. Newton chose the word ‘force’ for push or pull. So we see that Newton’s first law of motion is a particular case of the more basic philosophical doctrine that says, “Every effect has a cause”.<br><br>
  If we apply a force on a static body, it starts moving and gradually gains more and more speed. We conclude that a force accelerates a body. We also observe that greater force causes greater acceleration to a particular body. If force on a particular body is doubled, we get double acceleration; if force on it is ten times, we get ten times acceleration and so on. So force per unit acceleration is fixed for that body. That means the ratio of the applied force on a body to its acceleration is fixed for the body.  This fixed quantity has the name ‘mass’ of the body.  So mass = force/acceleration. This name mass is our convention. This is nothing but Newton’s second law of motion which we see to be an observable fact with a conventional name. We cannot prove that one yard equals three times a foot. It is our convention. Similarly, Newton’s second law cannot be proved.<br><br>
  If a car rams a weak structure in a street, the structure breaks down. But if strong enough, the car is destroyed. So both the car and the structure can exert force on each other. Being affected by the force depends on the relative strength of the objects. So when one body exerts a force on the other, the other body also exerts a force on that. Obviously, the two forces are opposite. Whether they are equal is a matter of closer examination. Newton investigated this and observed that these two forces exerted by two bodies on each other were just equal and opposite. This observed fact is Newton’s third law of motion.<br><br>

  These three laws of motion make the basis of classical mechanics.<br><br>
  Newton’s another law of supreme importance is the law of gravitation. From Galileo’s observation that all bodies gain equal acceleration in the gravity of the earth, we see that the ratio of the force of gravity on a body to the mass of the body (which is the acceleration) is a constant. So force of gravity is proportional to the mass of the body. The body will also exert an equal and opposite force to the earth and for the same reason we can conclude that this force is also proportional to the mass of the earth. This inspired Newton to conclude that gravitational attraction between any two bodies to be proportional to the mass of both the bodies. From Kepler’s observation that the planets revolve round the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus, the radius vector of a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times and the square of the time of revolution around the sun is proportional to the cube of the length of the major axis of the orbit, Newton calculated the dependence of gravitational force on distance. His calculation revealed that gravitational attraction is proportional to the inverse square of the distance between two point particles. Thus complete classical mechanics stands on these four firm pillars, viz. Newton’s three laws of motion and his law of gravitation. Though further developments of more convenient formulations of classical mechanics were brought to us by famous scientists like Lagrange, Hamilton, Jacobi, etc. the Newtonian formulation remains the basis. <br><br>
  Like the three laws of motion, the law of gravitation may also be arrived at by pure logical/ philosophical thinking as follows.<br><br>
  Will a one kg mass and a 10 kg mass fall with the same acceleration? A 10 kg mass may be thought to be composed of 10 pieces of one kg mass. These ten pieces should fall with the same acceleration as they are identical and under the same rule. As a result, the whole of the 10 kg mass falls with the same acceleration as the one kg mass. So we conclude that falling bodies have the same acceleration (of course at the same place) irrespective of their mass. Since different masses have equal accelerations, therefore the ratio of the force of gravity and mass = a constant acceleration. So the gravitational force is proportional to mass. So the mutual attraction of two bodies, i.e. gravitation is proportional to masses of two bodies. Again, since the empty space around a point-mass has the same property on all sides, any point in space having a particular distance r from this point-mass will have the same effect of gravitation. So this effect is the same on the surface of a sphere of radius r with centre at the point-mass. So the total effect on this spherical surface will be evenly distributed over the surface of area 4πr<sup>2</sup>. So the effect on a small area A on the spherical surface which another body covers will be proportional to A/4πr<sup>2</sup>. So gravitational effect (force) goes as 1/r<sup>2</sup>. Hence Newton’s law of gravitation is arrived at.<br><br>

  Up to this we discussed the fundamental aspects of classical mechanics which mostly involve the dynamical properties of material bodies under externally applied forces. Now we will discuss another type of dynamism which is common to the molecules of matter in a bulk. This gives rise to the subject of thermodynamics. We know that temperature is the external manifestation of the random molecular agitation in matter. James Clark Maxwell investigated the distribution of velocities among the molecules of a gas with the help of probability calculus. This is very akin to a socio-economic survey described as follows: We may observe the yearly income per head of the earning members in a society. Zero-income persons cannot survive. So their number will be zero. Very few persons will be beggars. The number of millionaires will be very small. Most people will have an average income. The number of persons having an income below that average will fall with lower and lower income. Similarly, income higher than the average will be found in fewer and fewer persons with increase of income. So the curve will be a rise and a fall in number of persons with a maximum at the average income. Really, we see the speed distribution curve for the molecules of a gas to be of a parabolic rise first and then an exponential fall when the speed is plotted along X-axis. The algebraic relation for this curve had been deduced by J.C. Maxwell with the aid of probability calculus. So we can borrow the abovementioned socio-economic concept to have a guess about the nature of the speed distribution of molecules.<br><br>
  Now, we come to a simple example where different approaches or viewpoints of thinking will lead to the same answer.<br><br>
  Let us take the example of a paperweight lying on a smooth table. If I push it for a very small time along the surface of the table, it will slide along and come to a stop at a distance. Why will it stop? Macro level of thinking will answer that the opposing force of friction is responsible for the loss of motion of the paperweight.  Micro level of thinking will argue as follows: When the paperweight is in motion, all its molecules have identical parallel motion. Force of friction gradually renders a chaotic motion to the molecules. When the molecules have a complete random motion, the kinetic energy of the paperweight is mostly converted into heat. For this the paperweight stops.<br><br>
  If I now warm the paperweight, will it start sliding on the table by the conversion of heat to kinetic energy? No, the completely chaotic motion of the molecules for heating cannot be converted into regular orderly motion causing the motion of the paperweight in a particular direction. Such creation of order from disorder in a natural process is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. A philosophical as well as scientific answer is to argue as follows: If the hot paperweight has to start moving on the table, it will have to go ultimately to a particular position on the table. But why will it choose that particular direction? Has any direction been made special by the process of heating? Certainly not. So the paperweight will not move at all.<br><br>
  Besides second law of thermodynamics, there are three other laws in thermodynamics. Zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third one, all these three bodies are in mutual thermal equilibrium. If thermal equilibrium is achieved by only equality of temperature, then this law is obvious. First law of thermodynamics is merely a special case of conservation of energy in the case of mutual conversion of heat and mechanical energy. The third law of thermodynamics indicates the unattainability of absolute zero temperature. Second law of thermodynamics has many versions proclaimed by many scientists. Modern analysis reveals that all these versions indicate to the fact that all natural processes increase disorder as a whole as time passes on. But there is a great question: From its creation, how has such a great order in this universe evolved during a huge span of time? No less serious is another question: Since the creation of life on the earth, how has such a huge ordering during the evolution come to being in the plant and animal kingdom? Are these the violation of the most sacred law of nature (i.e. the second law of thermodynamics)? I am longing for the answer.<br><br>
  Up to this we discussed the link between observation, scientific thinking and philosophical thinking. Actually, observation and thinking are parts of both science and philosophy. Sometimes scientific inference invites philosophical questions. For example, scientists conclude from experiments and observations that light travels in a straight line. Eventually a philosophical question may arise: How will we know whether light travels in a straight line or the path followed by light appears to be straight to us? When an electric bulb is lit in front of a mirror and we see its image in the mirror from a side , we see light coming straight to our eyes from the image though the light ray from the bulb to our eyes via the mirror suffers a sudden change in direction by the reflection at the mirror. In case of bending of light rays by refraction (passage of light rays from one medium to another), we see the source of light to be so displaced that the whole path of light from the source to our eyes appears straight. The more the scientists went on performing finer experiments on different optical phenomena, the more they acquired newer knowledge about the properties of light. Tremendous flood of philosophical thinking swept out the mind of every great thinker on the earth after the proclamation of wave-particle dual nature of light. Of course that is a big and great story to be told in a different essay. Electromagnetic character and speed of light in vacuum may create some other stories. These three aspects of light toppled the firm mansion of classical physics and have thrown much light to our mind’s eye causing a radical change in our entire scientific and philosophical views.<br><br>
  However, a live human brain along with the nervous system is by far the most powerful computer (if you call it) on the earth, where science and philosophy play their most complicated games. Though I admit that I am fortunate enough to have or to be (I don’t know) such a great computer, I have my most bitter experience (scientific or philosophical I don’t know) with it. Such experience teaches me that mistakes are so powerful that they easily and quietly creep into this wonderful machine.
