  Sequencing is a modern tool developed by scientists which allows them to get the complete genetic code of an organism i.e. the DNA sequence. Earlier, these sequencing studies used to take a lot of time but as science and technology has progressed, the duration of a sequencing project came down and right now can be completed within a matter of a few moments.
  <br><br> 
  Initially, there were two basic methods of sequencing: the Maxam Gilbert method and the Sanger method. The former method wasn’t really effective and utilized really toxic chemicals. Sanger sequencing on the other hand was very effective but then it couldn’t sequence large pieces of DNA. It took quite some time to sequence a DNA which was 1000 base pairs long. For those who aren’t familiar with biology, the DNA contains four base pairs A (Adenine), T (Thymine), G (Guanine) and C (Cytosine). In our DNA, A pairs with T and G pairs with C. And each of these pairings are termed as a base pair.

  Researchers worked on the method of Sanger Sequencing for quite some time and then different companies came up with different sequencing technologies which came to be known as Next Generation Sequencing. With Next Generation Sequencing, the sequencing time came down and so did the cost. Right now, Next Generation Sequencing allows the sequencing of upto three billion base pairs with each million base pair costing approximately 0.15$.

  Recently, researchers at Oxford University made a stunning advancement in the sequencing technology. They developed a Nanopore DNA Sequencer known as the MinION. This device allows the sequencing of a genome in very short time and at a very low cost. And not only that, this device is fully portable and can be operated in any sort of environment.

  To sum it all up, sequencing has come a long way from taking ages to complete a sequence to completing the in a matter of few minutes. Its only a matter of time before these sequencing devices become as compact and as portable like our handheld communication devices.
