  Hailed variously as a demigod and the ‘son of Jupiter’ in his own times, the charisma surrounding the  personality, life and adventures of Alexander of Macedon (the Great) has captured the fancy of historians, bards and storytellers alike even after centuries of his demise. The legendary fame of Alexander and his conquests is not only a staple of Greek patriotism, but also rather paradoxically, as Richard Stoneman has noted [1] , the stuff of tales and ballads in even those lands which were once his conquered dominions. Whetting the imaginative appetites of bards and storytellers extending from Andalusia in the west to China in the east, cutting across temporal, spatial and linguistic barriers, the historical memory of Alexander has morphed into quasi-mythical narratives, giving rise to a new genre of literature known as ‘Alexander Romance’, written in both poetry and prose. One such rigorous tradition of composing Alexander Romances has existed in medieval Persia too, between the early 11th to 15th centuries, after which no Alexander Romance of note has been composed.

  Needless to say, works of literature are not composed in a socio-intellectual vacuum. The characters in his writings are what an author makes them to be. Consequently, the convictions and opinions of an author have a lot of bearing upon how his characters are modeled, and these in turn are heavily influenced by the age and socio-intellectual milieu of which the author is a part. Here, I propose to examine three principal works- Abul Qasim Ferdowsi’s ‘Shah Nameh’, Nizami Ganjavi’s ‘Iskandar Nameh’, and Abdur Rahman Jami’s ‘Khiradnameh-ye-Iskandari’, all of which may be considered as representatives  of the Persian Alexander Romance epic genre, and thereby attempt to map the evolution of Alexander’s persona in this genre by placing these works in their respective socio-intellectual contexts. This paper, therefore, is a combined exercise in hermeneutics and legendary iconography.
  <br><br>
  Two distinct and opposing images of Alexander have existed in Persian literary tradition. The first, and older image ,derived from Zoroastrian priestly traditions, is that of Alexander as Iran’s arch enemy, the ‘Gizistag’ (accursed), a devil-incarnate and son of Ahriman (the arch diabolical figure in Zoroastrian mythology) who subjugates Iran, assassinates her legitimate king, decimates the priesthood and the nobility, and razes cities and fire temples to the ground. The second, and the more positive image of Alexander is derived from the lore prevalent amongst the Sasanid nobility, which probably had its roots in a Syrian recension of the Alexander Romance, and which later became Islamicized.[2]  In Ferdowsi’s Shah Nameh, an unresolved tension is evident between the older, negative and diabolical image of Alexander, and the newer, positive and by then Islamicized image. [3] In his work, Alexander is at once the accursed offspring of Ahriman, the arch enemy of Iran, and also the legitimate Iranian ruler, a world conqueror whose defining qualities are wisdom, generosity and piety- he is even shown as visiting the Kabah in Mecca. A closer inspection, however, reveals two reasons behind this literary anomaly. The first of these reasons is the sources which Ferdowsi has used in his magnum opus. As Haila Manteghi has demonstrated, the sources which Ferdowsi used in composing his legendary accounts were pre-Islamic and Persian, when the legend of Alexander had yet not been Islamicized and imbued with positive qualities. [4] Secondly, the reason behind this contradiction becomes all the more clear when one considers the literary backdrop against which Ferdowsi was writing. This was the period of the renaissance of the Iranian cultural and literary spirit, famously called the ‘Samanid Renaissance’ after its chief patrons, the Samanids. In Mahmud of Ghazni, Ferdowsi’s  patron, the Samanid renaissance had found a ready exponent. [5] Iranian patriotism, therefore, is the animating spirit of the Shah Nameh, and explains the deference paid by Ferdowsi to traditional Alexander –image in the Iranian ‘national history’ (Khwaday Namag). Also noteworthy here is how Ferdowsi appropriates Alexander into the line of Persian kings by making him half-Persian, as the son of King Darab from the daughter of Filqus (Philip), and therefore the half-brother of Darius – an act in keeping with the Iranian patriotic belief that prior to the Arabs, no foreign ruler had conquered Iran. [6]
  <br><br>
  By the time Nizami Ganjavi wrote his Iskandar Nameh, the image of Alexander in Persianate Muslim literary tradition had been fully Islamicized, and Alexander identified with the Qur’anic figure of ‘Dhul Qarnayn’ (the ‘two-horned’), and purged of all his former negative attributes. [7] In Nizami’s work, Alexander is still associated with the Greco-Roman antiquity as the king of ‘Rum’ (Byzantium), but he is no longer a Christian (as in Ferdowsi’s Shah Nameh), but a Muslim warrior and saint. In this two-part work, the first part, Sharaf  Nameh (‘the Book of  Honour’), Alexander is portrayed as a world-conqueror, moved not by the lust for wealth and temporal power, but by the missionary zeal to spread the civilizing rule of Islam. In the second part, Iqbal Nameh (‘the Book of Fortune’)he appears as a saint, surrounded by a group of (rather anachronistic) philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Porphyry etc. [8] Thus, the earlier kingly and martial aspect of Alexander’s image is greatly subsumed into his role as a saint-proselytizer. 
  <br><br>
  The association of philosophy with sainthood in Nizami’s portrayal of Alexander as a warrior-saint-philosopher is an interesting and rather bold statement, and must be seen against the backdrop of the intense mounting religious opposition to the influence of Greek philosophy over Muslim theology in Nizami’s own times, largely due to the pressure from the Ash’ari ulama, representing one of the two orthodox schools in Sunni scholastic theology (the other being the Maturidis),who stressed the primacy of revelation over logical and philosophical reasoning  in attaining objective knowledge of God. It was in the eleventh century, the one prior to Nizami’s, that Muhammad Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, the mystic and premier Ash’ari theologian, had composed his ‘Tahafut-ul-Falasifa’ (‘The Incoherence of the Philosophers’) - a polemical denunciatory tract against Greek philosophy, which signaled the start of the Sunni orthodoxy’s long and bitter war against philosophers. Furthermore, two related incidents within Nizami’s living memory had deeply impacted him- the execution of the 35-year old Shihab -ad -Din Suhrawardi, the founder of the Illuminationist (Ishraqi) school of philosophy in 1191 at the fatwa of a tribunal of theologians at Aleppo, and the banning of the septuagenarian Ibn Rushd (known in the West as Averroes) from his hometown Cordoba in 1195, and the burning of his books. Therefore, when Nizami combined the saint and the philosopher within the persona of Alexander, it was indicative of  his stance on philosophy, in whose defence he squarely stood – philosophy was for him God-given, an extension of man’s innate rationality, and therefore compatible with revelation. [9]
  <br><br>
  His kingly majesty and saintliness notwithstanding, Abdur Rahman Jami in his Khiradnameh –ye –Iskandari (‘the Book of Alexander’s Wisdom) develops the character of Alexander couched in distinctly humanistic terms. Alexander may be a world conqueror and saint-missionary, but he is nevertheless human, and therefore mortal- a fact underscored by his doomed search for the ‘Water of  Life’ (Aab-i-Hayat) which can grant him immortality, and by his request to his ministers to leave his hand hanging out of the shroud at his burial to demonstrate that he, a world-conqueror and paragon of spirituality, leaves the world empty handed just like all others. This emphasis on humanism in Alexander’s portrayal may be seen as a part of the larger trend of the efflorescence of Persian literary humanism in the Timurid Empire of which Jami was a resident, and also as a reflection of Sufi otherworldliness emphasizing the transient nature of the temporal world, whose roots lay in Jami’s Naqshbandi associations. [10] 
  <br><br>
  The evolution of Alexander’s image in medieval Persian epic literature, therefore, has been a process marked by constant interaction with the socio-intellectual matrix in which it unfolded- a highly variegated development, influenced directly by the socio-intellectual thought currents which animated the literati and intelligentsia of medieval Iran. From Ferdowsi’s robust Iranian patriotism , to Nizami’s philosophical sensibilities, to Jami’s passionate humanism and otherworldliness, each of these influences have left an indelible mark on the manner in which Alexander’s legendary persona has evolved, in the process transforming the folk memory of Alexander from that antagonist, alien conqueror and byword for tyranny to that of a familiar, homely icon- an epitome of all those values which the soul of Persianate civilization has always espoused. Somewhat similar has been the case of his Indo-Greek counterpart, Menander or Milinda, the inquisitive king of Nagasena’s  ‘Milinda Panho’, fondly remembered as the ‘Dhammaka’ (upholder of the ‘Dhamma’) in Indo-Buddhist canonical literature – a far cry from the distaste in which his Yavana Seleucid and Indo-Bactrian antecedents had been held by the classical authors. This indigenization and assimilation of the bitter memory of conquering foreign monarchs into the folk memory of the conquered through the agency of literature validates a point argued so passionately and eloquently by Jami- the role of literature as a unifying bond across humanity.
