  Surely Job Charnock did not bank his ship on the western bank of Hooghly three hundred years ago with the sole dream of metamorphosing three villages-Sutanati, Gobindapur and Kalikutta into a metropolis. His companions too had no desire to start playing games the moment they set foot on land. They were so busy then with the ambitions of the East India Company and their fulfilment that there was no time to breathe until the battle of Plassey had been won in 1757. Subsequently the trading power swiftly transformed itself into ruling power. Calcutta became the centre of Commercial and administrative might. The company officials now turned their attention to entertainment.<br><br>

  There is no specific record about when football was introduced in Calcutta or between whom was the first match played but we can surely say that the pioneers of football in Calcutta were civil servants who came with the East India Company, officers of the trading firms, members of the regimental battalions, and the European teachers from the educational institutions. However it was the Navy which contributed to the popular appeal for football in colonial Bengal. Soon after its introduction in the field of sports, the Europeans established their own clubs for playing football. But to the locals, playing football was still a novelty. <br><br>

  <p style="text-align: center;">‘Father of Indian Football’: Sports Culture in Colonial Bengal</p>
  <br><br>
  The introduction of the Modern day sports in Bengal as well as in India can be traced back all the way to 1835 under the governor-generalship of Lord William Bentinck. During his tenure, the great occidentalist Thomas Macaulay proposed to make a class of men who would be educated in English language and would be faithful to the English ruling class. These newly educated people integrated the western sports, such as Cricket, Football, Polo, Tennis and Snooker into the mainstream of Indian culture. The ruling class certainly had an imperial interest and that was to make the Indians ‘civilised’, which can be very easily tagged as a kind of cultural imperialism. The efforts were certainly very evident in the English medium schools and colleges of undivided Bengal. According to famous sociologist J.A. Mangan, the role of Christian missionaries, teachers of public schools and public servants were enormous. He also considers the distinct and co-ordinating role of imperialism and sports as ‘Games Ethics’. According to the English, the Bengalis were frail, despicable and unable as a race. English also used words such as ‘cowardly’ to define the Bengalis’ character. According to Thomas Macaulay himself:<br><br>
  
“The physical organisation of the Bengali is feeble even to effeminacy. He lives in a constant vapour bath. His pursuits are sedentary, his limbs delicate, his movement languid. During many ages he has been trampled upon by men of bolder and more hardy breeds. Courage, independence, veracity are qualities to which his constitution and his situation are equally unfavourable”.[1]<br><br>

English journalist G.W. Stevens has gone even a step further to characterise the Bengalis. According to him:<br><br> 

“By his legs, you shall know the Bengali. The legs of a free man is straight or a little bandy, so that he can stand on it solidly...The Bengali’s leg is either skin and bones; the same size all the way down, with knocking knobs for trees, or else it is very fat and globular, and also turning in at knees, with round thighs like a woman’s. The Bengali’s leg is the leg of a slave.”[2]<br><br>

The Bengalis showed a huge amount of laziness while choosing his games. According to the Europeans, the sports which the Bengalis played were sedentary. ‘Walking is better than running, standing than walking, sitting than standing, and lying down best of all’: such a myth was very famous amongst the Europeans about the love for sports amongst the Bengalis.[3]  The kick off in football came during the late 1870s from the person known as the godfather of Indian football, Nagendraprasad Sarbadhikary. According to a story, on a morning 1877, a young Nagendraprased alongside his mother Hemlata was going to the Ganges for his daily bathe. While passing by the Calcutta Football Club close to the Fort William, young Nagendra saw a few Englishmen running in the field with a round shaped thing. Being curious, he ordered to stop the cart and went to see what the Englishmen were doing. When the round shaped thing came rolling in front of him, a ten years old Nagendraprasad picked it up and started studying it. The incident as Kaushik Bandyopadhyay has said: ‘বলাবাহুল্য, বালক তো দূরের কথা, সে যুগে তাদের পিতারাও সাহেব, বিশেষতঃ সৈন্য দেখলে সাতহাত দূর দিয়ে যেতেন। অথচ নগেন্দ্রর মত নিতান্ত একজন বালককে একমনে খেলা দেখতে দেখে এবং বলটি কাছে আসা সত্ত্বেও পালিয়ে না যেতে দেখে গোরা সৈন্যের দল একইসাথে বিস্মিত এবং তুষ্ট হন। এজন্যই হয়তো সৈন্যদের একজন বীর বালককে অভিনন্দন জানাতেই এগিয়ে এসে বলটি দেখিয়ে বলেন: kick it to me’[4]. And with the kick of a jubilant ten year old, the Bengalis kicked off their love affair with the game of football. After his initial learning processes of the game, Sarbadhikary established several clubs for the Indians such as ‘Boys Club’, ‘Wellington Club’, ‘Friends Club’ and ‘Presidency Club’. Amongst these, the Boys Club needs special mention as it was patronised by Marquise of Ripon himself. Sarbadhikary was very close to Nagendranath Mullick of the famous Mullick family of Calcutta. He founded the Friends Club in the garden of Raja Rajendraprasad Mullick. On this occasion, a grand party was thrown in the famous Marble Palace of the Mullicks. Many of the who’s who of the contemporary Bengali society gathered in the occasion. The grandiose meant that the game of Football was now gradually becoming acceptable to the people of Bengal. But, amongst all the clubs that he established during his lifetime, the most famous is the Shobhabazar Club. Unfortunately after being listed as an attorney in the year 1902, Nagendraprasd left the sports field of Calcutta at a tender age of 31.[5]<br><br>
  
It can be safely said that Nagendraprasad was at the forefront of the initiatives that the Bengalis took in the field of western sports during the second half of the 19th century. He was unbiased to take stance for a player of lower cast of the society, such as Mani Das who was the son of a blacksmith or a confectioner. According to him, ‘I have not made a club with hereditary lines. I will not make the field of sports biased with casteism, but will make players’[6]. We should evaluate the initiative and sportsmanship in the lights of the contemporary colonial society and culture. During the 1880-90s, football was a game for the Bengalis to show off their physical strength and it was a way to communicate with the British. According to Kaushik Bandyopadhyay, ‘ideologically, the game had not become the cultural weapon to protest in the nationalist sense. Undoubtedly Nagendraprasad had opened the path to defeat the white colonisers in their own game, but with his good relationship with the British and his inclusion into the attorney list in 1902 meant that he was not yet ready to see the field of sport in the nationalist perspective’[7]. Perhaps the win of Mohanbagan in 1911 over the East Yorkshire regiment gave the first flash to the Bengalis to use the field of sports in a nationalist sentiment. <br><br>


  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Mohanbagan and 1911: Nationalism or Sporting success?</p>
  <br><br>
  The first momentous event in the history of Indian football was the winning of the IFA Shield by Mohanbagan. The club gained upper hand over five British teams that included crack military regiment teams such as Rangers, Rifle Brigade and Middlesex Regiment on their way to win the shield. In the finals Mohanbagan’s win over the East Yorkshire Regiment by 2-1 goals created a tremendous stir not only in Calcutta, but among nationalists all over India. A few years before this incident, Ranji's extraordinary success in a cricket field in England, had provided the Indian political leaders with a "hero". Dadabhai Naoroji had commented that a "rediscovery of India" had taken place through Ranji's performance. Mohanbagan's victory was greeted in the same spirit by the count.<br><br>

  Perhaps the victory of Mohanbagan over the ‘Crack’ East Yorkshire Regiment had more of a political colour in its fold. In 1903, Lord Curzon announced that Bengal would be torn into two. The next couple of years saw at least two thousand mass meetings in Bengal, demanding the withdrawal of the proposal. The division of Bengal took place in 1905. That day the hearths were cold in every home and Bengalis tied the rakhee on each other's wrist as a mark of solidarity. A new force was born in the national consciousness. Meanwhile terrorism was gathering momentum in Bengal. The news of the martyrdom of Khudiram and Prafulla Chaki had spread all across the country. The agitation against the division of Bengal had been transformed into a political movement for freedom when on 29 July, 1911 Mohanbagan won the Shield. The game of Football, though being a British sport was not rejected by Bengalis, but in the field of football, the Bengali players of Mohanbagan used a unique policy of protest: by playing the game barefooted. Four and a half months after this victory, at the Delhi Durbar, George V rescinded the partition of Bengal and announced the removal of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi. The Indians were mentally prepared to see the British Raj humiliated, cornered, and brought to their knees. Unexpectedly, that is what Mohanbagan achieved in the football field. For a brief while, the nebulous desire in the subconscious of the Indian people to come out the winner in the struggle for independence was made a tangible reality by Mohanbagan. No wonder they became the most popular football team in the country. Their matches against European teams were perceived as campaigns to dislodge the Raj. For Indians, a game between the CFC and Mohanbagan was a "prestige fight"— a battle for prestige and honour. <br><br>

  So, how do we classify the win of Mohanbagan over East Yorkshire Regiment in 1911? According to Kaushik Bandyopadhyay, during the ‘Swadeshi’ era, a huge portion of the Bengali society was educated and smart. But they were hesitant about joining the movements directly. Likewise, the urban bourgeoisie, such as office workers, clerks and working classes were unable to defy the English in their professions yet the majority of them had a great nationalistic enthusiasm.  So by defeating the English, the Bengalis relished the taste of winning their fight for freedom[8].  Ramchandra Guha traces the shift of capital from Calcutta to Delhi through the same routes via the football field in such a manner: ‘to pre-empt further humiliation the British adroitly and deliberately moved the seat of power to Bengal, away from its skillful footballers and bomb-wielding nationalists.’[9]<br><br>
  
  Historians such as Tony Mason and Paul Dimeo see the win of Mohanbagan as the moral victory of the games ethics initiated by the English in the public schools. Both Mason and Dimeo have shaped a Eurocentric theory. According to Mason, it is more important to understand the success of the imperial plan of the English to educate the natives through sports. He has stressed more on the ‘Games Ethics’ theory rather than the nationalist, racial or political aspect. Dimeo, though has agreed that the victory of 1911 was a very special point of the nationalist movement when the imperial ideology or the so called ‘physical superiority’ of the English was curbed in public and yet he states that the success was the result of the acceptance of the English moral structure started in the Anglo-Indian Public schools. He goes on further to taunt that the victory of Mohanbagan in 1911 showed the natives’ subjection to the cultural imperialism of the English.[10] Such an analysis, though, have been subject to great criticism. Boria Mazumdar in his article ‘The Vernacular in Sport History’ published in the Economic and Political Weekly has strongly criticized the Eurocentric views as historians such as Dimeo have given more importance to the English newspapers and English owned newspapers rather than the vernacular publications for the context of the victory of 1911.<br><br>

  Some are not interested to analyze the victory of 1911 either from a nationalist or an imperial point of view. According to Dwaipayan Sen, every writer has tried to portray the victory according to their own ideological stand point. He thinks that it would be better to analyze Mohanbagan’s victory in a larger scale and on the basis of the different reactions.[11]<br><br>


  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;Colonialism in Bengal football: Rise of Mohammedan Sporting</p>
  <br><br> 
  Although the British ruled the country till 1947, they withdrew from the sports field at the beginning of World War II. However, Mohanbagan could not complete the work of demolishing their power in the Calcutta football grounds. From 1915 onwards, Mohanbagan started playing in the Division League and the beginnings of the real tensions and excitements of the game can be traced back to those days. For the barefoot Bengali players, the rains were the main enemy, even more so than the British. In the earlier part of the football season, in the months of May or June, the Bengalis with the advantage of controlling the ball with their bare feet on the dry field, ranked second or third on the League table. The moment the rains came on the slushy slippery field it was the turn of the Bengali players to lose their game to the feet that wore the boots. By the end of the season they would descend to the fifth or the sixth rank. Along with the monsoons, the Bengalis firmly believed the biased referees were to blame for their defeat. Bengali sentiments about football in the 1920s and 1930s are made explicit in writer Achintya Sengupta's autobiographical Kallol Yug: "In those days, it was a monopoly of the British to be the referees and obdurate referees repeatedly caused trouble for Mohanbagan. An indisputable goal by Mohanbagan—and the whistle blows for an offside. The CFC is guilty of a foul—it is ignored or blamed on Mohanbagan. When there is no other way to undermine Mohanbagan, like a bolt from the blue, without a warning, comes a penalty charge[12]".<br><br>

  During the late 1930s, communalism took shape and grew steadily in Bengal as well as in India and the effects were showing off in the field of sports as well. In 1930, the newly established Mohammedan Sporting Club became the apple of the Muslims not of Bengal, but also of the whole of India. Till then as Achintya Sengupta writesin his autobiographical work Kallol Yug that "communalism had not entered the sports field. Mohanbagan then belonged to both the Hindu and the Muslim. The green galleries that burnt in the football stadium that day, carried the mark of both Hindu and Muslim hands. One brought the petrol; the other carried the matches"[13]. In 1911, when Mohanbagan won the Shield, the voice of the Muslim community, The Mussalman, had written: "It was a sense of universal joy which pervaded the feelings of the Hindus, the Mohammedans and the Christians alike. The members of the Muslim Sporting Club were almost mad and rolling on the ground with joyous excitement on the victory of their Hindu breth”[14]. <br><br>

  It was only natural, however, for the Muslim community find in Mohammedan Sporting a club that they could really call their own, when it emerged as a powerful team in the first division in 1934. At one time it was against the rules to have more than two Indian teams playing in the League in Calcutta. In 1914, for the first time, Mohanbagan and Aryan were allowed to play in the second division. In 1925 East Bengal made it to the first division. Meanwhile, with the political atmosphere hotting up in the country, the imbalance in the field of sports was removed and the clause which stated that only two Indian teams could play in the first Division League was dropped the same year. Once the door was opened, the number of Indian teams in both the divisions increased. Football in Calcutta was rejuvenated, which led to the introduction of the third and the fourth division in 1928 and 1932, respectively. By 1930, the Gandhian movement and the terriorists had aroused in Calcutta, especially among the students, such an intense and unwavering interest in the independence of the country, that the sports field no longer held the same position in their list of stimulating and exciting activities. The same year, after the first Division League had been on for three weeks, the Indian teams had to withdraw under political pressure and the game was abandoned. <br><br>

  Mohammedan Sporting was the first club to build a club on the basis of national selection. Players from places such as Bangalore, Delhi, Peshawar and Kabul would be selected and they would stay together in the club mess, receive training together and would also receive their monthly wages from the club. They showed the advantages of wearing boots to the Bengali teams for the first time. It can be easily remarked that the time between 1934 and 1942 be the ‘Age of Mohammedan Sporting’[15] in which they were the  first Indian club to win the  league in 1934 and continued to win it for the next four years. They won the league once again in 1940 and 1941 as they did not compete in 1939.  They won the Shield in 1936, 1941 and 1942. They were the runners-up in 1938 and won the Rovers and the Durand Cups in 1940. Until independence, there was no other Indian team with so many consecutive successes on the field.<br><br>

  Although such a fantastic success of the club was not seen in good eyes by the Hindus. The club being a Muslim dominated platform had generated an emotion which was a mixture of respect and fear amongst the Hindus. But they certainly did not feel any kind of joy in the massive success of the Mohammedan Sporting. Even a Mohammedan nationalist held the congress colour in one hand and the black and white flag of Mohammedan Sporting on the other. The Muslim League certainly being communal force it was, found the Muslim superiority in the success of the club as it was totally dominated by the Muslims. To be honest, during the 1930s, the competition was not between the British and the Indians, but it rather took the shape of a communal conflict between the Hindus and the Muslims. And it might be pointed out that the grand success of the great Calcutta killings of 1946 was much thanks to the success of the Mohammedan Sporting itself. Famous sport journalist and historian Moti Nandy points out: ‘The Muslims who were rolling on the ground with joy in 1911 at the victory of their Hindu brothers on the football field, had all disappeared, and been replaced by a new breed who came to watch the game carrying knives and bottles of soda water. They wanted to win both Pakistan and the football field by force. Indians had never displayed such aggressive spirits on the Calcutta sports fields before. Until 1947, the supporters of the Hindu clubs had felt pushed to a corner in the football field and outside’[16]. <br><br>

  Unfortunately, the advantages of building a successful club entirely on the patronage of rich businessmen and political leaders are offset by associated problems. Who knows when their selfish needs will be over, when their largesse will come to an end? The bunch of talented players who formed the core of the club were growing older, their performance was gradually deteriorating and the chances of success were striking. A club in Bengal could no longer afford to go hunting for talent. The Quit India movement of 1942, the economic insecurity generated by the war, the panic evacuation of Calcutta caused by the fear of Japanese bombs, the famine, the restlessness among the youth, and the communal riots that broke out on the day of the call for "direct action" by the Muslim League—the stress of all these events wiped out any enthusiasm for football in Calcutta. Because of the riots, there were no competition for the Shield in 1946 and the League was not played in 1947. Immediately after the subcontinent was divided in August 1947, having finally achieved their heart's desire, the patrons of Mohammedan Sporting left for either West or East Pakistan. The club's flame of success was extinguished, never to be revived again. In the last 42 years, Mohammedan Sporting has been the League champion on only three occasions.<br><br>

  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">East Bengal vs. Mohanbagan: Prestige War between the East and the West</p>
  <br><br>
  After the subcontinent was divided into two and the Muslims received much awaited dream nation of Pakistan in the east and the west of India, they started moving into their ‘own’ country. Hence the success of the Mohammedan Sporting came to a halt. The British owned clubs had already retreated from the maidan as the British rule in India was coming to an end. As soon as the British started to sell off their interests, the club tents also started coming down in the maidan. Clubs such as Rangers, Dalhousie, Customs and Police AC are yet to recover from this shock. Finally this restructuring came to an end in 1963 and it meant that Mohanbagan was the only recognized club of those clubs that remained active. But the fields of football in Bengal have never lost the excitement and jubilation as well as the competitive spirit and the team that has kept Calcutta entranced with its remarkable, exciting and startling performance— East Bengal. Indeed Surajjit Sengupta, one of the famous footballers of his generation has pointed out: “There would’ve been no football without the Bangal-Ghati rivalry. It is carrying a strong Bengali legacy. Much like Bengali poetry, literature, songs, Durga Puja and the traditional home-made sweets, it (football) also carries a legacy. There are Bengalis all over the world, and there is also the division between Bangal and Ghati. This is how Bengali football has become world famous. Hadn’t Bangal and Ghati been rivals, East Bengal and Mohanbagan matches would’ve lost much of its charm. Hadn’t this rivalry (East Bengal-Moanbagan) been a sporting and sweet and sour rivalry, at least twice in a year (now much more), Bengal would’ve witnessed bloody riots. But not only this hasn’t happened, the Bangal-Ghati rivalry has given several beautiful tales, many funny instances, thrilling excitement and drama and many splendid feats to the Bengali society”[17].<br><br>

  It is quite interesting to understand the terms that defined ‘Bangal’ and ‘Ghati’. Since the early 12th century, the people who came to the Western part of Bengal for their purpose of study and job from the eastern part (former East Pakistan, now Bangladesh) were known as or were tagged as ‘Bangal’[18]. On the other hand, for people of the western side of Bengal, the Ghati was an integral part of their daily life, starting from going to latrine in the morning to washing their hands after their lunch. And this thing would often fall into the wells. A group of people in the afternoon would roam around in the localities equipped with hooks and ropes and would shout: ‘Ghati Tulben!’ and the people from east Bengal who resided there thought that the people of West Bengal are known as ‘Ghati’[19].  The latest addition to this theory by renowned sports journalist Rupak Saha also indicates something of this kind. However after its foundation in August or according to some, September, 1920, the club had to go through a phase of great stress and storm. When in 1924 East Bengal got the chance of playing in the first division, the native clubs, in the leadership Mohanbagan and Arian rejected the proposal of promoting East Bengal to the First Division. But owing to the strong support of the British clubs such as Calcutta Football Club, Dalhousie, Rangers and Cameron’s, East Bengal could play in the first division. <br><br>

  If we take a look at the social structure of the native clubs of the contemporary time, we can easily understand the reason for opposing East Bengal by Mohanbagan and Arian. The clubs that led the fortunes of Indian football back then were mostly controlled and governed by the Ghatis or the people of West Bengal. In such a circumstance, if such a newly founded club as East Bengal plays in the first tier, then the glory and the prestige of Mohanbagan and could be curbed and at the same time, the Ghati legacy would also be curbed as they were governed by the so called ‘inferior’ Bangals. At the same time, the club members also thought about their fan bases because after the establishment of the East Bengal club in 1920, Mohanbagan lost about 20% of their Bengali Hindu fans. The Statesman correctly observes: ‘Many are thinking that the reason for such a queer intention(opposing East Bengal club a chance in the first tier of the Calcutta Football League) is because the two present Indian clubs (Mohanbagan and Arian) are not being able to see a strong competitor such as East Bengal with the eyes of gratification. They fear that such a strong team as East Bengal would reduce their fan base and they would find it difficult to sign new players.’[20]<br><br>

  The Ghati-Bangal war on the football field shifted from the level of the comic to the violent when, after the partition of Bengal, Hindu refugees arrived in droves in West Bengal from East Pakistan. Searching for a roof over their heads in the city and its surrounds a fistful of rice twice a day, they began their struggle for survival under conditions of unbearable hardship. Lost and impoverished, in an unknown territory and hostile environment, faced with severe adversities, they would sometimes lose the battle and fall back, then return once more to dream of settling down to a secure, and normal existence. It was in such circumstances that they discovered a football club called East Bengal which was fighting another battle in the field, and winning! They all ran in frenzied haste, to assemble under the club's red and yellow banner. The victory of East Bengal stood for the triumph of their dreams. In their miserable and deprived existence, the road to life was the one that led to the football field where East Bengal was playing. The club that belonged to the Ghatis was the main opponent for East Bengal. In their subconscious, therefore, the Ghatis were identified as antagonists. Mohammedan Sporting had brought with it hatred, through its aggressive communalism born of a minority's natural instinct for self-preservation. East Bengal brought anger, through regional, cultural and language differences, in the backdrop of a hostile social, economic, and political environment. East Bengal fought its battle in the field and its supporters, the refugees, waged their war against the Congress government outside. The war of the football field and the political war on the streets of Calcutta merged in the 1950s and the following two decades. There was a new tinge of colour in the craze for football in Calcutta which culminated in an explosion of euphoria. During this time, Mohanbagan reared its head occasionally aided by a few talented players, but East Bengal repeatedly wrested back its supremacy and raised its banner on the field. The Great Calcutta Derby can be placed side by side with other great derby matches such as Fulemenise and Flamengo of Brazil, River Plate and Bocca Juniors of Argentina, Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain, A.C. Milan and F.C. Internationalez (otherwise known as Inter Milan) of Italy, Manchester United and Liverpool in England, Bayern Munich and Borrusia Dortmund of Germany and Ajax Amsterdam and P.S.V.Eindhoven of Netherlands. <br><br>

  To conclude, Calcutta has been called variously "the home of Indian football", "the Mecca of Indian football". None of this is true any longer. Today the once highly respectable Mohanbagan has officials and players who chase and manhandle referees in the field. Realizing that they have once again fixed a match, the supporters of the club beat up the players and set fire to the tents. In 1980, during a match between Mohanbagan and East Bengal at the Eden Gardens, sixteen people died in a stampede when the audience fled in panic. Every year a voluntary blood donation camp is set up in the memory of the people who died, but not a single footballer has ever donated his blood in this camp. At the same time, the four Indian footballers who have been awarded the Padmashree are all from Calcutta. Between 1948 and 1960, India has participated in the Olympic Games four times. On all four occasions, the skipper was a footballer from Calcutta. In 1977, by inviting the Cosmos Club to Calcutta, Mohanbagan had provided football lovers with the opportunity of watching Pele in the field. Calcutta has one of the largest covered football stadiums in the world with a seating capacity for 120,000 people. Two of the streets of Calcutta have been named after two footballers. Only Mohanbagan has been accorded the privilege of being the "national club" by the AIFF. However, all efforts seem to have failed. Having witnessed on television more than a hundred World Cup matches since 1982, few people attend the tedious and effete fixed matches that take place in the city. When they do come, they do not worry as they used to, ten or fifteen years ago, about standing in a queue for the tickets forty eight hours before the game. The rootless refugees of forty years ago are now all settled in their lives. The battle for survival does not have the same intensity for their sons and grandsons. The West are introverts, naturally reserved, but they have not been able to hide the self-destructive dissensions among themselves and now publicly display a portrait of Bengali decadence. Their enthusiasm for football seems to have waned. In Calcutta, football awaits a grand resurrection. No one knows when and how and from which direction it will come. But the day will most certainly arrive, because Bengalis cannot live without football.<br><br>
