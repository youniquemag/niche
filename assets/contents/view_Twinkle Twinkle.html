   Respected Reader, if you like to read this article, you need only to have infinite capacity of forgiving my errors.
  Several thousand years ago little did our ancestors think when they beheld the rising sun that it was there not only to light our beloved earth but also to kindle our interest to unravel many mysteries that had been ever since the creation of the world.<br><br>

  Gazing at the twinkling little stars in the night sky, thousands of years ago our ancestors might have been astonished but scarcely could they imagine that these are not at all little as they appear.<br><br>

  Be it the twinkling light of the stars at night or the profuse flood of light from the sun sweeping out the darkness of the night, light in any form, if attracts anything - it is our mind.<br><br>

  While investigating the character of light, scientists got overwhelmed with joy unspeakable and the spectators of their experiments went flabbergasted. When Newton split the white light into seven spectral colours, certainly whoever saw it was amazed at the splendour. When Archimedes concentrated sunlight on the enemy’s ship by using many a reflector and the ship caught fire, certainly the king of Greece paid awesome respect to him.<br><br>

   As time passed on, many optical phenomena were discovered and many theories of light came up. Newton pictured light-ray as a stream of corpuscles. But it could not explain even refraction. In the year 1690 Christiaan Huygens announced the wave theory of light which could explain many optical phenomena. Thomas Young used this wave theory to explain interference of light (within 1800 to 1807 AD). Maxwell also arrived at the wave theory of light by employing the laws discovered by Gauss, Faraday, Lenz and himself. Maxwell identified light wave as a kind of electromagnetic wave. However, difficulty arose in the explanation of photoelectric effect. Wave theory could not explain it. Einstein explained it with the help of photon theory i.e. quantum theory of light, according to which light is a stream of particles of definite energy. Now two conceptual problems cropped up: whether light is a wave or a particle. Light is to have a dual character for the explanation of all types of optical phenomena. Another problem is that the wave equation derived by Maxwell gives the speed of light in empty space, henceforth denoted by c, to be an invariant quantity such that c cannot depend on anything, even on the motion of the observer or the source. Experiment by Michelson and Morley also indicated this constancy of the speed of light in vacuum. The first problem gave rise to the evolution of quantum theory and the second one gave birth to the theory of relativity (special).<br><br>

  We will discuss the theory of relativity first. But before doing that we have to take into account the fact that the theory of relativity cannot be understood just by applying our common sense. Day to day experience creates our common sense. Common sense has already created our concept of space, time, matter, energy etc. in some crude form. But there are facts outside our experience. These facts could be known to us by experiments of great precision. So experiments throw light to the field outside our experience. From this field outside our experience, we gather new knowledge inaccessible to our common sense. We analyse the findings of our experiments by logic. But the logical faculty we possess at present has developed from the knowledge we have already acquired. When we face a new situation due to the result found in a new experiment, we try to analyse the situation by our already existing logical faculty. But all such attempts fail when a new situation brings us face to face before a fact outside our experience. So then we have to rise above our common sense and already existing logical faculty and sometimes we might have to extend our logical faculty by admitting facts stranger than the images of our imagination. For example, if you go straight in a long drive with a uniform speed of 25 km/hour and your friend Shyam drives parallel in the same direction with a uniform speed of 29 km/hour, your common sense will tell you that you will see Shyam going with a speed of 4 km/hour in your direction. For all practical purposes, your answer is very much correct. Surprisingly enough, if those speeds are as high as 250000 km/second and 290000 km/second respectively, the relative speed will not be 40000 km/second; instead it will be nearly 205714 km/second! Yes, this is a fact and verified by experiments of surprisingly high precision.<br><br>

  This bizarre result, consequent upon Einstein’s special theory of relativity, gives us such a smart jolt on our intellect that no amount of mind bending and brainstorming imagination or logical construct can comprehend even a little bit of its underlying truth without the help of Einstein’s theory of relativity.<br><br>

  Some people comment that in his theory of relativity, Einstein meant to say that everything is relative; for example big and small, bright and dull, long and short, etc. Had it been so, the theory would have not required such a giant thinker like Einstein to construct it. On the other hand, triumph of this theory is due to the invention of what is not relative and consequently what changes we should bring about in our logical process of thinking.<br><br>

  Just as we behold the twinkling stars at a night sky with our naked eyes, exactly with the same ease and wonder Einstein, the bravest emperor ever reigned in the land of science, could visualise and profess the supreme truth in nature by virtue of his genius of Himalayan height and wisdom of oceanic depth.<br><br>

  Many scientists before him put forward many explanations of the null result of the famous Michelson-Morley experiment. But all such attempts were proved to be wrong. The repetition of Michelson’s experiment by Morley and Miller was the first definite evidence for the impossibility of detecting the translational motion of the earth. Analysing the outcome of this experiment, Einstein concluded that the speed of light in empty space is invariant. Speed of light in vacuum (empty space), henceforth denoted by “c”, is of such a nature that it depends neither on the speed of the source nor on the speed of the observer. That means it is not relative! It is absolute! If you drop a piece of stone from a moving car, the stone gains speed from the moving car (as observed by an observer standing outside the car). Light never behaves like this stone. It does not gain or lose speed from its source. Suppose a car is moving with a speed of 30 km/hour to the east. Your friend observes it while standing on the street and you observe it from another car moving parallel to it with a speed of 20 km/hour to the east. Certainly you will observe the car to have a speed of 10 km/hour to the east and your friend will see its speed to be 30 km/hour eastward. But in case of light travelling with speed c in vacuum, both you and your friend will observe the speed of light to be the same even if you go with an enormous speed nearly that of light either towards or opposite to the motion of light. This absolute character of “c” has many consequences so bizarre to our mind-set for the nature of space-time that we have to swallow the bitter pills of changing our concept of the very simple entities like length, duration, simultaneity, mass, energy etc.<br><br>

  Einstein deduced the quantitative effects of motion on length, duration, simultaneity, mass, energy etc. These effects are prominent only when the motions involved have velocities very near to c. If a spaceship carrying a rod flies away from us along the length of the rod and we measure the length of the rod from behind, we will get the length to be shorter than the length of the rod when it is at rest with us. This is called length-contraction. If the same spaceship carries a clock, we will observe the clock to run slower than a clock at rest with us. This is called time-dilation. A mass in high-speed motion is heavier than it is at rest. This is called mass-variation. Another astonishing result of the theory of relativity is the mutual convertibility of mass and energy. The profuse release of energy at the blast of a nuclear bomb results from the conversion of a small amount of mass to energy. But this conversion is not a direct transmutation of mass into energy. The source of energy in the fission of uranium is mainly the electrostatic repulsion of the two parts into which the nucleus is split. The binding energies of the particles in an atomic nucleus show up in their masses and therefore the release of energy is in this indirect way related to the changes in the masses of the nuclei. Elementary particles are created from kinetic energy in many experiments. Such particles appear always in pairs of particle and corresponding antiparticle. This process is called pair creation. When such a pair unites, it is completely annihilated and forms radiation. Creation and annihilation of such pairs are examples of direct conversion of energy to matter and vice versa. This indicates the equivalence of mass and energy. This concept of equivalence is a very important outcome of Einstein’s special theory of relativity.<br><br>

  But it raises a serious question against the thesis of several philosophical systems of the past that ‘substance’ cannot be destroyed. However, in modern times we have seen that electron-positron pairs can be completely annihilated and transmuted into radiation. Does it indicate the falsity of the older philosophical systems and that the arguments brought forward by the earlier systems have been disproved by the theory and experiments of modern physics? This conflict readily withers away if we notice that the term ‘substance’ in ancient or medieval philosophy cannot be simply identified with the term ‘mass’ in modern physics; rather we have to consider mass and energy as two different forms of the same ‘substance’ to keep the idea of substance as indestructible. Otherwise how could we expect that the thoughts of the philosophical systems of the past that were formed from the bulk of knowledge available several hundreds of years ago could be reconciled with the concepts developed out of the phenomena that can only be observed by the elaborate technical tools of modern times? At this point of our present discussion one can of course ask for the relevance of this tacit attempt to reconcile old philosophical thoughts with modern scientific thinking as described above. Here it is to be mentioned that such an attempt of reconciliation is necessary if we want that both philosophy and physics may go hand in hand in the path of progress of modern knowledge evolved out of critical analysis of the phenomena observed through our most modern technical tools of high precision. As time passed from the age of medieval period onwards, philosophers and scientists were on the way to refining their thoughts bearing the signature of their astonishing foresight. One example, worthy enough to mention here is the thought advanced by the illustrious mathematician and philosopher Leibnitz that matter is a colony of souls. What other entity of nature than energy could he mean by the term ‘soul’ here? Though it might seem the only normal thing to say since the ground breaking discovery of the theory of relativity, but the curious fact is that Leibnitz said this roughly two hundred years before Einstein’s birth. Doesn’t this thought of Leibnitz speak the truth of mass-energy equivalence? This single example teaches us not to ignore older thoughts altogether without analysing them in the light of modern knowledge. I think that there is some substance in the saying that science is blind without philosophy and philosophy is lame without science.<br><br>

  Before going into a further discussion of philosophical implications of the theory of relativity, its further development has to be described. We saw that we can reconcile the older philosophical thoughts with the findings of the special theory of relativity. Moreover, the theoretical findings of this theory got a firm ground of their experimental verifications. Special theory of relativity is special in the sense that it is based on the equivalence of all inertial frames. Generalisation of this concept to the case of accelerated frames sprang out in 1915-16 when Einstein formulated his general theory of relativity. We know that pseudo forces appear in accelerated frames. These forces are proportional to the masses on which the forces act. Einstein watched that the force of gravity on a body is also proportional to its mass. This fact led Einstein to perceive a connection between inertia and gravity. The most accurate measurements have never shown any deviation from the exact proportionality of the mass of a body as a measure of gravity to the mass as a measure for its inertia. So Einstein put gravitational forces on the same level with the centrifugal forces or with other forces that arise as a reaction of the inertia. Since these pseudo forces had to be considered as due to physical properties of empty space, Einstein advanced the hypothesis that the gravitational forces also are due to properties of empty space. Again, gravitation is produced by mass. So if gravitation is connected with properties of empty space, properties of empty space must be influenced by mass. Since the properties of space change with the gravitational fields, the geometry of space has to be compared with the geometry on curved surfaces. As a result, the general theory of relativity emerged out as a mathematical theory of space and time, curved by virtue of mass and gravitation. So the geometrical scheme of Riemann was preferred to Euclidean scheme in the development of this general theory of relativity. In the 19th century, the mathematicians Bolyai, Lobachevsky, Gauss and Riemann constructed geometrical scheme other than Euclidean. In the 20th century, Einstein employed this discipline of mathematics to construct the geometry of space-time and the effect of gravitation and mass on space-time and vice-versa. The particular branch of mathematics used is called general tensor analysis. This theory predicted a few interesting effects. For instance, first we mention the precession in the orbital motion of the planet Mercury, and then we mention the effect of bending of light passing close to a heavy mass, and thirdly the red-shift of starlight due to the gravity of the star.<br><br>

  Mercury moves round the Sun in an ellipse, with the Sun at one focus. The point on the orbit nearest to the Sun is called the perihelion. In the time between a nearest position (perihelion) to the next, Mercury does not go exactly once round the Sun, but a little bit more. It moves one-tenth of a second of angle more than a complete revolution to get from one perihelion to the next. This can be fully explained by Einstein’s theory.<br><br>

  Although the old notion was that light must travel in straight line in vacuum, it was possible to admit that light must be deflected out of the strait path in passing near the Sun. But according to Einstein’s new theory, light would be deflected twice as much as this (in this case) by the Sun. That is the ray would be deflected by an angle about 1.75 second.<br><br>

  Eddington pointed out that there are a number of bright stars which come almost in line to the Sun on 29th may every year. But there light can only be detected during a total eclipse of the sun. There was such a total eclipse on 29th May, 1919. Two British groups photographed the stars near the Sun during the eclipse and the results appeared to confirm the prediction of general theory of relativity. But this result and those of subsequent observations were not of much accuracy. But after some years, scientists observed the deflection of the radio waves coming from quasars almost in line to the Sun. This time the observational technique was very accurate and the result was in good agreement with the new theory.<br><br>

  Thirdly, general relativity predicts that a periodic process will get slower if it is under the effect of a strong gravitational field. The emission of light from atoms is a periodic process and gets slower at the surface of the Sun where the gravitational field is much stronger than that on the Earth. So the same atomic source of light will emit light waves of different frequencies from the surface of the Earth and from the surface of the Sun. The frequency of the light from the Sun will be lower. So in the solar spectrum, the spot of a particular colour will shift towards the red end in comparison to the same spot for a terrestrial source. This is called the gravitational red-shift. This effect has been reliably verified in experiments much after Einstein’s prediction.<br><br>

  However, the geometrical concept and construction taken up by the theory of general relativity was far beyond the reach of the older ideas of Euclidean geometry. So the old questions of the behaviour of space and time had been raised in an entirely new form. Consequently, very old philosophical problems were taken up that had been posed by the men of the earliest phases of philosophy and science. Some very deep questions were asked – Is space finite or infinite? Is there any beginning of time? What will happen at the end of time? Is there no end or beginning of time? These questions had different answers in different philosophies. In the philosophy of Aristotle, the total space of the Universe was finite. Space was due to the extension of bodies, it was connected with the bodies, and there was no space where there were no bodies. The universe consisted of the Earth, the Sun, the planets and the stars: a finite number of bodies. Beyond the sphere of the starts there was no space; so the space of the universe was finite.<br><br>

  In the philosophy of Kant this question was one of the antinomies (questions that cannot be answered), since two different arguments lead to opposite results. To whichever point in space we come, we can always imagine that we can go beyond. So space cannot be finite. Again, space is something we can imagine, otherwise the word ‘space’ could not have been formed and we cannot imagine an infinite space. So space cannot be infinite. Kant’s conclusion is that a rational answer to the question whether space is finite or infinite cannot be given because the whole universe cannot be the object of our experience.<br><br>

  According to St. Augustine, time is passing only for us; it is expected by us as future, it passes by as present and is remembered by us as past. But God is not in time. Time has been created together with the world; it belongs to the world, so time did not exist before this world existed. There was no time before He created the world. But if someone asked, ‘what was God doing before He created the world?’ then Augustine’s immediate answer was, ‘God was busy preparing hell for those who ask such foolish questions’. In such arguments, the word ‘created’ is the root of all troubles. ‘Created’ means something has come into being that had not been before and consequently it presupposes the concept of time. This fact teaches us the lesson that every word or concept has only limited range of applicability.<br><br>

  Different models of the universe and cosmological pictures have been built with the aid of the astronomical observations on the distribution of galaxies in space. But our present astronomical knowledge cannot give us the power to judge the superiority of a particular model to another and we are not in a position to give definite answers to the above questions. We can only say that ‘the space is finite’ does not mean that there is an end of the universe at some place; it means that by proceeding farther and farther in one direction in the universe one will finally come back to the point from which one had started. Time seems to have a beginning. Many observations indicate that the age of this universe is 15 to 18 billion years. <br><br>
  
  The above discussion about the theory of relativity is really an ultra-small story of the extra-large cosmos. Quantum theory is the rules and regulations governing the extra-small world or microcosm i.e. the world of molecules, atoms and fundamental particles. The impact of quantum theory and its philosophical implications will be discussed in the next article.<br><br>
