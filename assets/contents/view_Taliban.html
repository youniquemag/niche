  The nature of the US military involvement in Afghanistan, post the 9/11 attacks, was transformed in its entirety. No longer fighting a proxy war to oust her arch-nemesis from a strategically important country which served as the crossroad between South Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia, USA was now engaged in the herculean task of toppling a regime which sheltered the perpetrator of her greatest national security breach to date, and then finding and punishing the perpetrator himself.<br><br>

  The bombings which began in 2001 had, by the next year, ousted the Taliban regime from power, and forced its leadership as well as the rank and file into a retreat. Yet, within a matter of the next five to six years, the Taliban were able to stage an insurgency, and a stunning comeback in the bordering tribal regions, which took everyone by surprise. As important as asking why the things went downhill so rapidly after the initial success, is asking what were the forces at play which enabled the Taliban to recuperate, regroup and replenish their human and material resources, and which now nourish and sustain its insurgency against the NATO forces and the Afghan government? Evidence points towards a very unlikely actor who, though admittedly not the sole force at play, is deeply invested and a vital stakeholder in the Taliban insurgency- the Deobandi madrassas of Pakistan.<br><br>


  <p style="text-align: center;">The Deobandi Movement : Origins, Militancy, and ties with the Taliban</p>
  <br><br>
  The Deobandi movement originally began as a reform movement within Sunni Islam, emerging in the wake of the revolt of 1857 and in response to the changes taking place within the Indian Muslim society with the establishment of the British colonial rule. Established in 1867 in the small town of Deoband in the north-western United Provinces by two mutiny veteran clerics, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi and Abul Qasim Nanautwi, the ‘Dar-ul-Uloom’ seminary sought the revival of  traditional Islamic values through training a new generation of Ulama in the Sharia (Islamic Law) and the Tariqah (path of spirituality), in such a way that they would be able to interpret the classical canonical sources in consonance with the realities of the modern world pressing in upon the Muslims.[1] <br><br>

  The Deobandi movement has, historically speaking, quite early links with Afghanistan. Within a few years of its foundation, Afghan students began to arrive at the seminary in Deoband. In the early 20th century, the Afghan monarchy had requested the cooperation of the Deobandi ulama in establishing modernized, state-controlled madrassas. The seminary reciprocated by sending a delegation of Ulama at the coronation of king Zahir Shah in 1933, who in turn assured that Deoband would help in raising a generation of Ulama who would be better acquainted with the realities of the modern world and cooperate closely with the state. However, the seminaries affiliated with Deoband did not become very popular in Afghanistan.[2]<br><br>

  The Deobandi movement fostered an anti-colonial temper and the Ulama of Deoband lent their support to the nationalist struggle fought under the aegis of the Indian National Congress, and by far agreed to its vision of a secular, composite nation.[3] However, a splinter group within the movement broke with the mainstream later on in the struggle, sided with Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his call for a separate state for Muslims, and in 1947 floated their politico-religious movement called Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI) in Pakistan, in order to give the Deobandi movement a political voice and propagate its beliefs. Gradually assuming increasingly puritanical, militant, Islamist and anti-Western tempers, under its leader, Maulana Mufti Mahmood, and later his son, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the JUI began to talk in favour of global jihad and established hundreds of madrassas in Baluchistan and the North West Frontier Province, along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, inhabited largely by Pashtun tribesmen. To the impoverished residents of this region, and the thousands of Afghan refugees fleeing the war in the 1980s, these madrassas offered the only avenue to literacy. Far removed from the original reformist agenda of the Deobandi movement, these madrassas were staffed by semi-literate rural teachers whose understanding of Islam was based not so much on the scriptures as it was on the ‘Pashtunwali’, the Pashtun tribal code of ethics. A steady flow of funds from Saudi Arabia, as a part of the conservative, hardliner Sunni kingdom’s policy of countering the influence of Shia Iran in South Asia, further brought these madrassas under increasing Wahhabi influence. It was in these madrassas that an entire generation of Taliban militants was to be educated and indoctrinated, and it is these madrassas which would be the chief source of Taliban’s manpower and its ideological incubatory when it began its insurgency in the years after 2002.[4] 


  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">The JUI, Madrassas and the Taliban Suicide Bombing Cells</p>
  <br><br>
  The links between the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, its network of madrassas, and the Taliban have just been discussed. Its current leader, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who has also been a coalition partner in the Benazir Bhutto government formed in 1993, has traditionally been a staunch supporter of the Taliban, and has voiced his support for them on several occasions. Utilizing his position as the Chairman of the national Assembly’s Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, he was able to lobby with Washington and the European powers for the Taliban, as also with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, in order to enlist their support for the movement.[5] It was from the madrassas under his patronage that thousands of religious students had volunteered to fight for the Taliban in their lunge for power in 1994. His unflinching support for the Taliban continues in the post- 9/11 years, and in their second bid for power.[6] <br><br>

  These madrassas serve as conduits for recruiting young boys, preferably from the Afghan diaspora settled in Pakistan, and then induct them into the ranks of Taliban’s suicide bombing cells, set up as parts of their insurgency tactics since 2006, when a spate of suicide bombings rocked the whole of Afghanistan.[7] A typical example of such recruiting centers is the madrassa Jamia Darul Uloom Islamia. Located in a nondescript corner of the neighbourhood of Pashtunabad,  a district in the city of Quetta peopled largely by the Afghan refugees, it is the local headquarter of the Taliban’s insurgent movement, being visited frequently by such persons as Mullah Dadullah, a senior Taliban functionary.  The madrassa was run by Maulavi Jan Muhammad, whose brother, Mullah Wali Jan, had served as a governor under the Taliban regime. This madrassa had been the alma mater of at least three Taliban suicide bombers, whose activities had been traced back to the institution.[8]   Interestingly, when the British journalist Carlotta Gall’s Pakistani associates went to interview the madrassa’s deputy head, Qari Muhammad Ibrahim, in 2006, they reported having seen a big, wide banner painted across the wall of the building praising the madrassa’s patron, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, and the Taliban leader Mullah Omar.[9] The point, therefore, is plain to be seen- it is the strong hand of Fazlur Rahman which is pulling all strings, utilizing his network of madrassas in Pakistan in order to mobilize military support for the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan.


  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Taliban’s Alma Maters: Darul Uloom Haqqania, Jamiat- ul-Uloomi Islamia, and the War in Afghanistan</p>
  <br><br> 
  Located in Akora-Khattak in the North West Frontier Province is another symbol of the Pakistani Deoband’s support for the Taliban- the Darul Uloom Haqqania, another notorious madrassa which is affiliated with the Deobandi sect. Founded in 1947 by Maulana Abdul Haq, a student and then teacher at the Deoband seminary, the madrassa is a sprawling establishment consisting of large, whitewashed residential blocks located on the main Peshawar-Islamabad highway. Now overseen by Abdul Haq’s son, Maulana Samiul Haq, the madrassa provides education to 1500 boarding students and 1000 day students, a majority of them from the Pashtun areas of Afghanistan and North-Western Pakistan.<br><br>

  Samiul Haq has great respect for the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, and has historically had strong ties with the Taliban. In 1999, at least 8 Taliban cabinet ministers were graduates of the Haqqania madrassa, with numerous other graduates serving the regime in the capacities of provincial governors, military commanders, bureaucrats and judges. Samiul Haq would maintain close personal ties with Mullah Omar, advising him on international relations as well as on jurisprudential issues.  In 1997, after the Taliban’s defeat in the battle of Mazar-i-Sharif, Mullah Omar sent distressed calls for help to Samiul Haq, and the latter shut down his madrassa and sent his entire student body to fight alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan.[10] As per the claims of the madrassa’s spokesperson, Syed Mohammad Yusuf Shah, ninety-five percent of the Taliban fighting in Afghanistan had passed through its classrooms, and the institution’s most famous graduates are Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani, the former having served as a minister under both the Mujahedin and Taliban governments, and the father-son duo commanding a network of militants along the Pak-Afghan border region known as the ‘Haqqani Network’, mobilizing their resources to provide safe haven to al-Qaeda and Taliban insurgents in the tribal Pashtun  belt of north-western Pakistan.[11]<br><br>

  The Jamiat-ul-Uloomi Islamia, another Deobandi madrassa located in Binori Town, Karachi, is another bastion of Taliban’s support on Pakistani soil. Founded by the late Maulavi Muhammad Yusuf Binori, it has a strength of around 8000 students, among them many Afghan students. Several ministers serving the Taliban regime have studied here. The madrassa continues to send a steady stream of graduates to bolster the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan.[12]<br><br>

  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</p>
  <br><br>
  
  The link between these madrassas and the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan is therefore amply demonstrated. At a time when the Pentagon is seriously considering increasing the number of American troops in Afghanistan, the ideological legitimacy and military aid provided to the insurgency by these institutions must be taken into account. How the combined NATO-Afghan Security Forces will tackle this influence remains one of the biggest questions of our contemporary geopolitics.<br><br>

[EDITED]<br><br>

CLARIFICATION FROM AUTHOR: The points I had made in my article were directed against religious extremism, and not religion in itself. If viewed anew, it shall be clear that I have been careful to distinguish between the views of the original Darul Uloom seminary situated at Deoband, India, and the ideas preached by these madrassas who are at best a splinter group, an offshoot that has parted ways from the original reformist-revivalist agenda of the seminary, right on the outset. I have, within my article, noted with appreciation the Darul Uloom’s contribution to the Indian national movement and the freedom struggle. To those readers with even a nodding acquaintance with the problem of religious extremism within the Indian subcontinent, it would be clear, in view of the fatwa issued by the Darul Uloom Deoband in 2008 against global terrorism, that such violence as is endorsed and enabled by these madrassas is in no way accorded legitimacy by the original Deoband seminary.
In calling attention to the problems posed by these institutions towards the security and integrity of the republic of Afghanistan, I have done nothing but echo the opinions of such luminaries as Ahmed Rashid, Carlotta Gall (my debt to whose works in acknowledged in the bibliography of my article) and the producer-director trio Hemal Trivedi, Mohammed Ali Naqvi and Jonathan Goodman Levitt (who have directed and produced the award-winning documentary film ‘Among the Believers’ on the problem of  religious extremism within Pakistan) – persons of excellent journalistic and secular credentials. It would, therefore, be greatly painful for me if my words are seen as an act of effrontery against the Deobandi maslak (denomination), something I firmly deny having done.
