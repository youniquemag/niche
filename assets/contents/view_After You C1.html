  What adheres two people together?  
  <br><br>
  I have often rummaged for that answer in the blind interiors of my mind, where one stumbles upon the darkness more often than the light. 
  <br><br>
  Perhaps, I just needed a rephrasing of my question or of the place I have been searching for its answer.
  <br><br>
  Man cannot live in isolation, yet there are quite a few of them, feeling empty and abandoned, scared and lonely amidst a crowd of people. The very idea of finding content in attachment and that too with people, seems surreal to me.
  <br><br>
  Why risk your emotions to people at all, which undergo change in interests and desires more often than the firmament changes its colour and can’t be held accountable for.
  Rather, risk them to things that neither demand nor complain, judge nor threaten to leave you at an undesirable scenario. Could you find one, yet?
  <br><br>
  No, I wasn’t a consistent believer of such humour since forever, but like I said, it has been brought about quite recently in me and I have allowed that change to take over.
  <br><br>
  What has, though?  Well, that I’m willing to share with you.

  <p style="text-align: center;">CHAPTER 1</p>
  <br><br>

  Bringing forth various incidences from the archive of my memories can be painful but then, I have grown less susceptible to jeopardizing my feelings, for I have none remaining towards those.<br><br>
  The perks of being a child is, the feelings you have are dismissible and none scar you till the end of time. Maybe that, and few other aspects of it, is longed for in the height of adulthood.<br><br>
  ‘I don’t have a good feeling about it’, I said to myself as I looked away from an annoyingly bright poster that read ‘Let today be your best’, on the stranded wall across the platform.<br><br>
  It has been twenty minutes since the metro’s scheduled to arrive, and nothing has seemed to distract me from the agony of reaching to work late.<br><br>
  I work as a microbiologist and a part time analyst in one of Russia’s biggest firms called Lifetoyl, and today just seems to be the last day of it, considering the current scenario.<br><br>
  I settled at one of those semi comfortable benches provided on the platform, relieving my legs a bit of the pain it has borne for too long. ‘Looks like I’m nowhere near to reaching the office within an hour, so might as well complete some of my work here’. I brought out my laptop and began going through some of my papers on progressing antibiotics under microbial prejudices, when suddenly,<br><br>
  ‘Emma, are you? Um..Robertson?’ said a rather confused voice, louder than it should’ve been, standing before my laptop, taking a quick peek of reassurance. <br><br>
  I looked up, a little greater than my visual angle and found a familiar face before me sporting a bizarre grin.<br><br>
  ‘Adam?’<br><br>
  ‘No, it’s Clay. Adam? How on earth could you think we look alike?’ he laughed.<br><br>
  ‘Oh, oh…I must’ve been thinking about something else. Hi, though. How have you been?’<br><br>
  He seated himself comfortably beside me, creating lesser room for me and my things till I finally adjourned my work and packed my laptop in the bag.<br><br>
  ‘These days just work, you know? My wife gets tired of me having a more promising affair with my laptop than with her’<br><br>
  ‘I can imagine.’ I laughed.<br><br>
  ‘What about you, though? Oh, do you remember Nathan?’<br><br>
  The name struck me before he got to its end. A moment of impact, was he talking about Nathan Ross?<br><br>
  ‘..Ross?’<br><br>
  ‘Why, yes. So you do remember. Well, that fellow’s getting married in a month. Hell of a guy, that Nathan. We all keep wondering what took him so long to find his girl; he ought to have found it first.’<br><br>
  Of all people, he was much more than just a name that I remembered and for him, I knew that I was the reason which took him so long to finally get married to someone else.<br><br>
  ‘Oh that’s wonderful. I should get going though, it seems like the metro is about to arrive.’<br><br>
  ‘Nice talk, Em. It was good seeing you.’<br><br>
  I smiled and turned away. It wasn’t good seeing him.<br><br>
  ‘Uh, Em?’ he called out.<br><br>
  I turned, ‘Yeah?’<br><br>
  ‘Are you gonna go, I mean, to the wedding?’<br><br>
  ‘I haven’t been invited, Clay.’ I smiled and walked away, this time, faster.
