  It is that time of the year again. School is ending, and the entrances are gaining traction. One usually starts with the usual suspects of engineering and medical in May, and finally culminates with the grand UPSC examinations in August. The grand carnival of Indian entrance examinations. Observation suggests that there seems to a peak of derogatory and casteist “memes” in social media simultaneous with this season of entrances. Large group of privileged individuals, with access to a computer, English education, electricity, and internet – a combined package of luxury that is enjoyed by about 10 percent of the population in the country – condemning the “others”, the people who allegedly discriminate against them, and most importantly, their ‘merit’. 
  <br><br>
  There exists a plethora of literature that speaks of ‘merit’, and how merit is nothing but a reflection of an individual’s social location. This article would rather focus on the two major allegations that are levied against the beneficiaries of affirmative action and the possible solutions that may be explored for them. 
  <br><br>
  The first allegation states that the beneficiaries of the affirmative action are mostly privileged, and therefore they do not deserve the affirmative action. The truth is that many empirical studies, such as Veronique Gille’s 2012 study, does affirm the fact that affirmative action tends to give a greater benefit to those that are relatively well-off among the social group that is being targeted. However, this does not mean that social action benefits those who are well-off in general (pun intended). The targeted social groups are extremely marginalised in comparison to the general populace in the country. Even the most privileged among such a group would – in their entirety – meet the requisite conditions of affirmative action. Even if, for the sake of argument, one accepts that some people who get affirmative action are more well-off than those who don’t; it must be noted that the number of such people would be so far and so low that they would not create any statistical impact which is significant enough to make a case for mistargeting. Furthermore, Gille’s 2012 study shows that there is also a case where people who are relatively better off, do not apply for affirmative action considering the stigma that is associated with it. Therefore, the question of mistargeting somewhat gets regulated by itself. Hence, it is clear from empirical data that there is no truth in the allegation that affirmative action is enjoyed by those who do not ‘deserve’ it, as per the assessment of the well-off sections in society, it is a service delivery problem and not a problem that is embedded in the principle of affirmative. There can be deliberations about different methods of targeting and allocation, but it would merit no discussion on the principles of affirmative action. 
  <br><br>
  The second allegation stems from the question of competence. The beneficiary of affirmative action may not have the competence to perform the professional roles that is demanded of the person due to their position in society. The general chorus indicates things such as doctors who are beneficiaries of affirmative action would tend be incompetent – in more impolite sense of the term, murderers of innocent people. Such prejudices are nothing but an external construct to stigmatize those that benefit from affirmative action. There is no case study, or empirical evidence, that may even remotely indicate the fact that doctors who are beneficiaries of affirmative action tend to have a higher number of malpractice cases than the rest. No such evidence exists in no other profession either. In fact, a recent research by the Stanford University has actually shown that, in higher education, students who are the beneficiaries of affirmative action tend to be keener learners than those who are not. Therefore, it must be acknowledged that competence is a function of ‘merit’ and education. Merit is nothing but a reflection of an individual’s social location, a construct that flows from the resources and opportunities that one is exposed to. Simply put, someone with access to a better library – holding motivation constant – would perform better than someone who has no access to external academic resources. The point regarding motivation has just been negated with the research that shows the beneficiaries of affirmative action tend to be keener, and more motivated, towards their learning than those that do not receive affirmative action.

  In conclusion, the propaganda surrounding affirmative action – unfortunately, both the positive and the negative – are motivated wit vested political interests in most cases. However, the propaganda in favour of affirmative action can be considered as a lesser evil, even with a possible political interest, as it is a necessity for a better society. A society which creates equity benefits everyone equally, even those that enjoy privilege. A society that is stratified is dangerous even for those who deem themselves the oppressors, as stratification creates volatility that endangers stability. If some people fails to see the bigger ethical reasons for affirmative action, which is reiterated almost every day, people must consider affirmative as a rational choice that would increase the common good and the collective welfare as a whole. Stigmatizing affirmative action would benefit no one. Definitely not those who need it the most, and certainly not those who believe that the absence of affirmative action would reaffirm old and existing power configurations – also known as the oppressors.
