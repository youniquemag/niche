  <p style="text-align: center;">CHAPTER 2</p>
  <br><br>
  Troubled thoughts, crumbled pages parting now and then with the gradually thinning diary and my sane self led astray. Complemented by a cup of coffee and I was always good to go.<br><br>
  
  ‘I can keep myself from thinking about him, thinking about this.’ I repeated to myself, often losing my mind over simplest of errors being made in my surroundings.<br><br>
  
  Clearly, Clay had left my heart hanging, more so from a bitter place which I had abandoned many years ago. Relatable, right? <br><br>
  
  It wasn’t normal, atleast it didn’t seem to be, to think over something, rather someone, whom I had buried in my past along with his memories. But I just couldn’t.<br><br>
  
  It’s amazing how no length of time can be enough to completely let go off something that you once held on to quite dearly with your all.<br><br>
  
  Not even 14 years could.<br><br>

  ‘I think you’re fat and ugly.’ a disturbingly charming grin before a decent face overshadowed the extreme obnoxiousness of the comment just made on me.<br><br>

  ‘Wow. So we finally have something in common, then.’ <br><br>

  I had forever wondered what about me could have possibly triggered the absolute hatred he’s been showering upon ever since he laid eyes on me. <br><br>
  Nathan Ross, if not the most sought after, maintains a decent record of the number of girls crushing on him, probably because of his impressive grades topped by his basket ball skills. Besides having a major attitude problem (which quite shockingly draws the female crowd even more towards him), he also nurtures an unacceptable ‘overeating disorder’ which makes it all the more surprising to even be likeable.<br><br>

  When I really think about those intolerable insults he throws at me, I realize that they are just tar coated words which are basically not completely untrue. <br><br>

  I have never quite been the definition of an ideal type, actually, not even in that neighborhood. <br><br>
  
  I had always made my peace with it considering other seemingly impressive attributes I took pleasure in, like singing and writing, until it dawned on me that absolutely nothing matters until you have a decent body type or a face, for that matter. Definitely not when you’re in high school. 
  And Nathan made sure it didn’t.
